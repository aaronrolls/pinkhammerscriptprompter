**ACT ONE**
**SCENE ONE**

sd: *Lights up on a well-loved workshop, a shrine to masculinity. A place for everything and everything in its place. There's a small TV on and we can just hear a cricket match being broadcast. The place is dimly lit by a lamp on a small table beside an armchair in front of the TV. It's getting dark outside.*
sd: *There is a tentative knock on the door.*

- **LOUISE:** (*Off*) Hello? (*She taps again*) Hello?

sd: *LOUISE cautiously opens the door and enters, looking around.* *From outside the door we can just see the corner of a car in the carport. She searches through her bag and brings out the Pink Hammer flyer, she checks her watch. She scratches. She goes and looks out the workshop window at the back of the room. She looks at the TV for a minute, then she checks the flyer again and gets her phone from her bag. She is about to phone the number on the flyer when suddenly the door flies open.*

- **HELEN:** (*Calling out as she enters*) Hello?
- **LOUISE:** (*Yelps*) Aaaah!
- **HELEN:** Sorry.
- **LOUISE:** No, no, it's fine. I'm sorry, hello.
- **HELEN:** Maggie?

# Page 26

- **LOUISE:** No, no, I'm Louise.
- **HELEN:** Is this the Pink Hammer Workshop?
- **LOUISE:** Oh, yes, I think so. That's a relief, I wasn't sure I was in the right place. I followed the directions on the flyer but I was beginning to ... I have this habit of being early for things as a rule just in case something happens to make me late. I was thinking maybe I'd got the day wrong. (*Checks the flyer again*) But today's the second, isn't it, so we must be right. Seven-thirty.
- **HELEN:** I'd say we're the first ones here then. I'm Helen.
- **LOUISE:** Hi. I'm so glad someone else turned up. Bit strange to be wandering down someone's driveway, past their house, in case you're not in the right place.
- **HELEN:** This looks like the right place. Plenty of tools.
- **LOUISE:** None of them pink, though. (*Laughs*)

sd: *No response from HELEN. LOUISE takes off her jacket.*

- **LOUISE:** It does look like the right place, though. Luckily.

sd: *HELEN looks around and then goes over and sits in front of the TV. LOUISE scratches. Silence. LOUISE hates silences.*

- **LOUISE:** Do you have any woodwork experience, Helen?
- **HELEN:** Not really.
- **LOUISE:** No, me either. Total newbie.
- **HELEN:** expect most of us will be.
- **LOUISE:** Yes, I expect so. (Looks at the flyer) Should we check up at the house?
- **HELEN:** It's not quite seven-thirty yet.
- **LOUISE:** No. I'm sure she'll be here.

*Beat.*

# Page 27

sd: *LOUISE looks out the back window.*

- **LOUISE:** Do you live nearby or ...
- **HELEN:** I live out Marton way.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, that's quite a trek, isn't it? Especially in the evening.
- **HELEN:** Not really, it's nothing.

*Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** I'm from Christchurch originally so I'm used to the flat. We moved up here years ago, but I know some people have a heck of a job finding their way around in Palmerston, you know without any sort of landmarks.

*Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** Do you work in the rural sector then?

- **HELEN:** Used to. These days I just collect the money from stud fees.
- **LOUISE:** Oh?
- **HELEN:** Horses.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, I see.

*Beat.*
sd: *HELEN watches the cricket on TV.*

- **LOUISE:** I used to be in a pony club when I was about ten. I got my D certificate for being able to name all the parts of the bridle and saddle.
- **HELEN:** Did you learn to ride?
- **LOUISE:** No. Turns out I was allergic to horsehair. Um, let's see: brow-band, noseband, throat-lash... pommel... cantle...

sd: *HELEN picks up the remote and raises the volume slightly. LOUISE comes over to look at the TV.*

# Page 28

- **LOUISE:** I can't follow the rules of cricket. All the names, Silly mid-on, silly mid drift, wide balls, it's like another language, isn't it?
- **HELEN:** Hmm.

*Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** Are we playing?
- **HELEN:** This is an old game from the summer season. Someone's recorded it. Blackcaps versus India.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, the Windies. I've heard of them.
- **HELEN:** No, that's the West Indies. India.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, Pakistan, right

sd: *HELEN takes a steadying breath. LOUISE moves upstage to look out of the window again.*

- **LOUISE:** Saddle flap, skirt, um, stirrups ... cheekpieces! I wonder if we'll be the only ones here?
- **HELEN:** (*Quietly*) Oh, God, I hope not.
- **LOUISE:** Ah, here's someone coming with a bicycle. Could be Maggie.

sd: *LOUISE opens the door.*

- **LOUISE:** Hello there.

sd: *SIOBHAN half enters with her bike.*

- **SIOBHAN:** (*Breathless*) Hiya. Is this the place? The Pink Hammer?
- **LOUISE:** Yes, we think so.
- **SIOBHAN:** Thank God for that.

sd: *She parks her bike offstage and enters the workshop throwing her bag down. Starts to take off her jacket.*

# Page 29

- **SIOBHAN:** I still can't get used to it, you know? This place is as flat as my nana's tits, not a hill or a twenty-storey feckin' housing estate to give you a heads-up - what were they thinking?
- **LOUISE:** I was just saying that, wasn't I, Helen?
- **SIOBHAN:** (Taking off her helmet and fluffing up her hair) God, what does my hair look like - hate these damn things. I've been up and down so many driveways looking for this place, the number's, like, tiny. They'll probably have the cops out by now. I'm Siobhan, by the way.
- **LOUISE:** I'm Louise and this is Helen.
- **HELEN:** Thanks, Louise.
- **SIOBHAN:** Hiya. And Maggie?
- **LOUISE:** We're not sure, we haven't seen her yet.
- **SIOBHAN:** Well, she better show up soon. I should be down at the Albert for the quiz night semis. I'm going to be in for a fair amount of shite from the Palmy Paddsters. They'll never get the ponderous puzzle without me, thick as pig shite. (She looks about the place) Maggie's got a cosy wee set up here, hasn't she?
- **LOUISE:** Yes, she has. Very cosy, very neat. So, are you from Ireland?
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, now what on earth gave you that idea?
- **LOUISE:** Your accent.
- **SIOBHAN:** Right. Well, I've been here going on six years now, so New Zealand is pretty much home. I was banished from the Emerald Isles when I made the mistake of yelling at a nun to get a job. Now I can't go back.

# Page 30

- **LOUISE:** Really?
- **SIOBHAN:** Huh, near enough.

sd: *SIOBHAN gets her phone out and starts texting.*

- **LOUISE:** Do you have any experience with woodwork?
- **SIOBHAN:** Nah, the only tools I know about are the ones I've dated. I've learnt never to trust a man who says he's good with his hands.
- **LOUISE:** I expect we are all here for a variety of reasons really. Helen's a horse studder and I'm-
- **HELEN:** Breeder! Horse breeder.
- **SIOBHAN:** Ah right. You might be familiar with my boss then - Martin Sullivan?
- **HELEN:** The Bunnythorpe bed-hopper?
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Laughs*) Is that what they say? Now that I didn't know. Vet by day, home-wrecker by night?
- **HELEN:** Yes, I know Marty. We go way back.
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Looking at HELEN slightly suspiciously*) Right.

sd: *Silence as the women wait. LOUISE scratches a bit and looks at the flyer again. HELEN continues watching the TV.*

- **LOUISE:** We could try to phone Maggie, just to check if she's been held up. The number's here.
- **SIOBHAN:** I'll do it if you like. Call it out.
- **LOUISE:** 027-

sd: *Offstage we hear a crash - the sound of someone tripping over a bicycle.*

- **WOODY:**(*Off*) Shit! What the fuck?

sd: *WOODY enters, flinging open the door, rubbing his shin in pain.*

# Page 31

- **WOODY:** (*Yelling*) What the hell are you doing in here?

sd: *The women are speechless. They just stare at him.*

- **WOODY:** (*Still yelling*) Who the hell are you?
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Nervously looks around*) Who wants to go first?

sd: *HELEN turns the TV off.*

- **HELEN:** I'm Helen.
- **SIOBHAN:** Siobhan.
- **LOUISE:** Louise Isobel Barnes.
- **HELEN:** We're here for the Pink Hammer Workshop.
- **WOODY:** The pink what?
- **HELEN:** Hammer. Are we not in the right place?
- **WOODY:** What the hell place are you looking for?
- **SIOBHAN:** The Pink Hammer Workshop.
- **WOODY:** The pink what?
- **HELEN:** I think we're going round in circles here.
- **LOUISE:** (*Holding out the flyer*) Tonight at seven-thirty.
- **SIOBHAN:** Empowering women with tools.
- **WOODY:** What women?
- **HELEN:** Well, us, hopefully.
- **SIOBHAN:** With tools.
- **WOODY:** What tools?
- **SIOBHAN:** These tools most likely.
- **WOODY:** Like bloody hell you are.

# Page 32

- **LOUISE:** (*Nervously referring to the flyer*) 'Maggie Taylor is passionate about furniture making. Join her as she guides you through basic carpentry skills and chisel away at the stereotype that has kept women out of the toolbox for so long. Go down the drive to the workshop at the back of the house-'

sd: *WOODY snatches the flyer, reads it, then goes up to the back window and stares out.*

- **HELEN:** Do you have any idea where Maggie might be?

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Did she leave a message or anything?

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Helpful chappie, isn't he?
- **HELEN:** You do know Maggie Taylor, right?

*Beat.*
sd: *WOODY turns, screws up the flyer, throws it and goes to storm out. He opens the door and collides with ANNABEL who's coming in.*

- **ANNABEL:** Oh, hello. I'm sorry, I'm

sd: *WOODY pushes past her.*

- **ANNABEL:** Excuse me!

sd: *ANNABEL enters.*

- **ANNABEL:** Is this the woodwork course?
- **LOUISE:** Pink Hammer, yes. But there seems to be a bit of a problem.
- **SIOBHAN:** There's a chance we're in the wrong place.
- **ANNABEL:** No, we're not. I sat nav'd it. Not a part of town I am familiar with. Who was that?
- **HELEN:** One of the seven dwarfs. Grumpy, I think.

# Page 33

- **ANNABEL:** And Maggie Taylor?
- **SIOBHAN:** Hasn't shown up yet.
- **ANNABEL:** Right, well then, what to do? I'm Annabel, by the way.
- **LOUISE:** Louise Isobel Bar.
- **HELEN:** Helen.
- **SIOBHAN:** Siobhan.
- **ANNABEL:** Not a great start, is it? I'm sure when Maggie turns up it will all be sorted out. I just talked to her on the phone yesterday morning and there were no indications the course wasn't going to go ahead.

sd: *ANNABEL takes her coat off and looks around. She sees a girly swimwear calendar on the wall - Miss July.*

- **ANNABEL:** Oh, God, look at that. Look at it. It's hard to believe these things still exist these days, isn't it? Not the sort of thing I'd expect to see at an empowering women's workshop. Unbelievable, it's not even on the right month.

sd: *ANNABEL rips the calendar off the wall.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Um, Annabel, I'm not sure that's a good move. You know technically there's a chance we shouldn't be in here.
- **ANNABEL:** Of course we should. Four of us have turned up, so we must be in the right place, and I'm assuming we've all prepaid? Maggie was quite clear about that.

sd: *The women all nod in agreement.*

- **LOUISE:** That's why I hate internet banking, you can't cancel it like a cheque.
- **ANNABEL:** Has anyone phoned her?
- **SIOBHAN:** We were just about to. Louise, grab me the number, will you?

# Page 34

sd: *LOUISE gets the screwed-up flyer, straightens it out and hands it to SIOBHAN who starts to dial.*

- **ANNABEL:** (*To HELEN*) You don't play bridge, do you? Helen, isn't it?
- **HELEN:** Not even remotely.
- **ANNABEL:** Only I feel like I know you. You look familiar, have we met before?
- **HELEN:** I doubt it.
- **LOUISE:** This is all a bit disappointing, isn't it?
- **ANNABEL:** wouldn't worry. I'm sure she's on her way. Have you checked at the house?
- **LOUISE:** There were no lights on when I came past.
- **SIOBHAN:** Bugger, straight to answerphone. (*On phone*) Oh, hiya, Maggie. Siobhan here. Um, it's about the workshop - there's four of us here but you're not... here, um, so, um, we don't know if we're in the right place, so... But if you get this message, could you call us back? Ta. We'll wait a wee bit, (*To the others*) shall we? (*They all nod*) Goodo, we'll wait ten minutes, say, and hope to hear back from you. Cheers, Maggie.

*Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** (*Looking out the window*) That man's coming back! You'd better put the calendar up.
- **ANNABEL:** No, it's sexist and inappropriate. He'll just have to deal with it.
- **LOUISE:** But if it's his place, don't you think-
- **ANNABEL:** I'll discuss it with Maggie when she arrives.

sd: *WOODY enters.*

- **WOODY:** It's cancelled, okay. Whatever she said, it's off.

# Page 35

- **ANNABEL:** I'm sorry-
- **WOODY:** Whatever it was she was planning to do, she's not doing it now, okay? So, if you don't mind picking up your broomsticks you can all bugger off.

sd: *WOODY waves them towards the door.*

- **ANNABEL:** Charming and clichéd - assertive women being stereotyped as witches. How very eighties.
- **SIOBHAN:** And technically mine's a bicycle not a broomstick.

sd: *WOODY gives her a killer look.*

- **WOODY:** Get out. All of you. Now!

sd: *HELEN and LOUISE start to get their things.*

- **LOUISE:** It was nice meeting you all anyway.
- **ANNABEL:** No, wait. Maggie is the only person qualified to make that call, don't you think? We've paid to be here. There is such a thing as consumer rights, you know?
- **SIOBHAN:** What she said.
- **ANNABEL:** (*To WOODY*) I'm really hoping this isn't some kind of scam you and Maggie have got going.
- **LOUISE:** We paid in advance, you see. We'll get that back though, won't we?
- **WOODY:** Don't care. Mags is not going to show. End of. So bugger off.
- **HELEN:** Is this 'Mags' by any chance related to you?
- **SIOBHAN:** Or is she an automotive part?

*Beat.*

- **WOODY:** She's my wife.
- **HELEN:** Thank you.

# Page 36

- **SIOBHAN:** Well, that's progress.
- **WOODY:** And just so as you know, mags would technically be classified as a car part, not an automotive part.
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, I see. Cheers for that.
- **ANNABEL:** And is it too much to ask if you know where your wife is?
- **WOODY:** Yes, it bloody is. And if you don't shift yourselves, I'll call the cops.
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, shit.
- **HELEN:** Call the cops? You do that. I'm sure they'd be very interested to find what you've left there in your ashtray.
- **SIOBHAN:** What is it? Drugs?
- **ANNABEL:** Why does that not surprise me? Highbury, of course.
- **WOODY:** West End, actually.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, God, are we in a tinny house?
- **WOODY:** Look, what I do in my own shed is my own bloody business.
- **HELEN:** Not if it's illegal. And there's witnesses.
- **WOODY:** Eh?
- **HELEN:** Listen, this has got a little bit out of hand. We just left Maggie a message asking her to call us within ten minutes. If we don't hear from her, we'll be out of your hair. How does that sound?

sd: *WOODY thinks, grunts and goes and sits in his chair. He surreptitiously picks up roaches from his ashtray and puts them into his pocket.*

- **ANNABEL:** (*To WOODY*) Thank you for calming down. I'm sorry, but do we know your name? I'm Annabel, by the way.

# Page 37

*Silence.*

- **ANNABEL:** Hello?
- **SIOBHAN:** She's not asking for your PIN number you know, just a-
- **WOODY:** Woody.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Seriously? Woody?

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Priceless.
- **ANNABEL:** Thank you, Woody.
- **SIOBHAN:** Of course, we could all go down to the Albert for a pint while we wait, if that makes it better? Drinking is team building after all.
- **HELEN:** Spoken like a true Kiwi.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, I don't really drink.
- **ANNABEL:** And I don't really drink in sports bars, Siobhan.
- **SIOBHAN:** Right.

*Beat.*
sd: *WOODY gets up, goes to his beer fridge, cracks open a beer and takes a long sip.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, now that's just taking the piss.

*Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** This is a lovely workshop, Woody. My father had one just like it.
- **ANNABEL:** Mine, too. Painted silhouettes on the wall where the tools lived. Old jam jars and tobacco tins full of nails and screws.

# Page 38

- **HELEN:** A bottle of single malt stashed somewhere. The odd 'Playboy'.
- **ANNABEL:** A man cave. Yes, from a psychological perspective it's always been important for a man to have his own physical space - a basement, garage or workshop like this. Somewhere to retreat to in order to process his feelings.
- **SIOBHAN:** Feelings about what?
- **ANNABEL:** Well, his job or stress or emotional pain, sometimes. Here, he can create his own masculine fantasy world.
- **HELEN:** A place to be uncivilised.

sd: *Monumental burp from WOODY.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Yowza!
- **HELEN:** Looks like we've found it.

*Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** Are you trained in psychology, Annabel?
- **ANNABEL:** Counselling. Same difference, really. Examining the human condition and helping those lost in the mire.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, right.
- **SIOBHAN:** My dad had a man cave in the garage. Since he never owned a car, it basically doubled as an Irish pub.
- **ANNABEL:** It's the fire-gazing zone. They come home, they don't want to hear about your day or talk about theirs, they want to decompress. Fire-gazing. (*Points to the IV*) Screen-gazing is our modern equivalent. Sometimes it's the idea of emancipation, an attempt to distance himself from his mother-slash-wife, as a way of preserving his sexual autonomy.

sd: *WOODY scoffs and goes back to his armchair.*

# Page 39

- **ANNABEL:** I know it probably seems like we've invaded your personal space, Woody. And that's maybe why you're feeling a little hostile right now. You may even be feeling intimidated, or threatened?
- **WOODY:** Would take a shitload more than you lot to intimidate me.**
- **ANNABEL:** (*Nodding to the others*) Threatened.

*Beat.*
sd: *WOODY suddenly remembers he's left sausages frying.*

- **WOODY:** (*To himself*) Shit!**

*WOODY gets up and storms out, banging the door behind him.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Aw. Just when it was all going so well.
- **HELEN:** He's as jumpy as a colt before gelding.
- **LOUISE:** Maybe it's drugs. It could be P. We should just leave. He seems really angry we're here.
- **ANNABEL:** No, we stand our ground. I find that man obnoxious, but I'm not backing down.
- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah, it's not like we deliberately invaded his space. We paid for it.
- **HELEN:** My money's on a domestic dispute - I think they've just had a row.

*Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** Do you think we should check up at the house? You never know what might have happened, do you?
- **ANNABEL:** You have a point there, Louise. (*She looks out the back window*)

# Page 40

- **HELEN:** I'm sure she's fine. I doubt he's got her trapped inside.
- **ANNABEL:** Well, let's hope not.
- **LOUISE:** But what if she's injured? What if she's needing help?
- **ANNABEL:** He is showing poor impulse control.
- **LOUISE:** Did you see when he came in, he had dirt on his hands? Maybe we should check the garden?
- **HELEN:** Steady on. It's not 'CSI' you know. Let's just give it another few minutes, before we round up the posse, eh?

*Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** I brought muffins if anyone's interested.
- **SIOBHAN:** Brilliant, I missed dinner. I'm feckin' starving.
- **LOUISE:** I thought if we had a tea-break, you know?
- **ANNABEL:** Lovely.
- **SIOBHAN:** Good thinking.
- **HELEN:** And so it begins.

sd: *LOUISE gets the muffins and a tub of butter from her bag.*

- **ANNABEL:** What begins?
- **HELEN:** The whole-ah, nothing.
- **ANNABEL:** No, go on, what were you going to say?
- **HELEN:** It's just ... Well, it happens every time, doesn't it? You get a group of women together for whatever reason and invariably it becomes all about food. Before you know it, everyone's taking turns at bringing a plate.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, I like to bake. It's no bother to me. I live on my own now so it's nice to make something people can share.

# Page 41

- **HELEN:** And if you don't want to bring something to share? If you don't have your turn? What sort of woman does that make you, hmm?
- **ANNABEL:** No one would judge you, Helen.
- **HELEN:** Hah. Right.
- **ANNABEL:** Maybe you're scared of your own judgment - of yourself?

sd: *Bit of an awkward moment. HELEN looks at ANNABEL.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Well, I don't think there's much that scares Helen. Full credit on the way you called WOODY on his dope.
- **LOUISE:** I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-
- **HELEN:** Oh, don't mind me, Louise. I prefer horses to humans, so what would I know? But as a point of reference for the future, ladies, if the Pink Hammer ever gets off the ground I will not be bringing a plate, just so you know.
- **ANNABEL:** That's absolutely fine. No one is asking you to. Some women like to nurture, that's all.
- **HELEN:** Not this one.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, I forgot the knife.
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Hands LOUISE a chisel*) Here, use this.
- **LOUISE:** Thanks. (*She starts buttering*)
- **SIOBHAN:** And that, by the way, ladies, is a bevelled chisel. Just so you know. Be careful though, Louise. It's feckin' sharp.

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** What sort of muffins are they?
- **LOUISE:** Banana. Gluten and dairy-free.

# Page 42

- **SIOBHAN:** Niiice.
- **LOUISE:** Just in case there's anyone like me who suffers from allergies.
- **ALL:** Hmm.
- **LOUISE:** Mind you, the doctor thinks it's more likely stress that causes it. Or the, um, 'change, you know? But how do you eliminate that from your diet?
- **SIOBHAN:** That's what alcohol was invented for.

sd: *She goes up to the beer fridge and opens it.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Speaking of which, do you think WOODY would notice a beer missing if I move them round a bit?
- **ALL**: Yes.
- **SIOBHAN:** I'd pay him for it . .. eventually.
- **HELEN:** Not the point. A man I knew fell off his deck on his fiftieth, got a concussion, couldn't remember his birth date but could tell us how many beers he had left in the fridge.
- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah, true that.
- **LOUISE:** (*Buttering*) I'm not sure I should be using this, really. Most likely all the things in here belong to Woody.
- **ANNABEL:** Why do you assume that? They might be Maggie's.
- **HELEN:** I get the strong impression they're his tools. He knows exactly what he's got in here.

sd: *They all eat in silence. SIOBHAN's mobile rings.*

- **LOUISE:** (*Yelps*) Aaaah!
- **SIOBHAN:** Christ, Louise. It's just my phone.
- **LOUISE:** Sorry, I live on my own. It's very quiet.

# Page 43

- **SIOBHAN:** (*Finds her phone and answers it*) Hiya. Oh, no. Yeah, well it depends what it is. What? Look, hold on, will you? (*To the others*) Not Maggie. (*She exits to talk outside*)
- **ANNABEL:** Do you work, either of you?
- **HELEN:** Retired.
- **LOUISE:** But you still have something to do with horses, don't you?
- **HELEN:** Minimal now.
- **ANNABEL:** Racing or breeding?
- **HELEN:** Both.
- **ANNABEL:** I don't know where I would have met you then, but I feel I have. Do you play tennis?
- **HELEN:** No, I can't be bothered with all that racket.

sd: *LOUISE laughs.*

- **ANNABEL:** What about you, Louise? What do you do?
- **LOUISE:** I trained as a nurse.
- **ANNABEL:** Do you work at the hospital?
- **LOUISE:** No, not any more. The muffins do not taste great.
- **LOUISE:** Shall I butter any more?
- **ANNABEL/HELEN:** Not for me. / I'm fine, thanks.

sd: *SIOBHAN enters.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Well, that's the weekend gone. God knows how, but I am now officially on a feckin' keg-racing team.
- **HELEN:** Mangatainoka?

# Page 44

- **SIOBHAN:** If you say so. Jamie, my cousin, has got through to the finals of the digger-excavation competition, so has had to pull out from the keg race, so now apparently I have to represent the family and show them what the Paddies are made of etcetera. I tell you, the fun never stops in Palmy, does it?
- **HELEN:** Virtue is its own reward, Siobhan.
- **SIOBHAN:** I'd better be rewarded! Hey, does anyone know if those kegs are empty or full for the race?
- **HELEN:** Empty by the end, I'd say.
- **ANNABEL:** The Dickens Book Club!
- **SIOBHAN:** What?
- **ANNABEL:** That's where I know you from. When you said just then, Virtue is its own reward', that's a quote from Dickens, I suddenly remembered where I've met you before. As I recall, you only came to one or two meetings though, didn't you?
- **HELEN:** Two meetings too many, as it turned out.

*Awkward pause.*

- **ANNABEL:** And why was that? I mean, was there something that put you off?
- **HELEN:** Just not my kind of people.
- **ANNABEL:** But The Dickens Book Club is made up of all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds. Who exactly are 'your kind of people?
- **HELEN:** Now that I really don't know. Anyway, I doubt very much that I was missed.
- **SIOBHAN:** You know it's just occurred to me that maybe WOODY can't tell us where Maggie is because she's left him?
- **LOUISE:** Or she's disappeared?

# Page 45

- **SIOBHAN:** He'd tell us if she had disappeared.
- **LOUISE:** Depends on the circumstances. We should check the boot of his car.
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, come on, Louise.
- **ANNABEL:** I just talked to her yesterday.
- **LOUISE:** And today she's gone. I honestly don't think we can rule out foul play.

sd: *LOUISE jumps as WOODY enters with a plate of three blackened sausages.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Now that's foul play! Look, he's murdered those bangers. (*Quietly to the others*) I'd say she's definitely left him.
- **LOUISE:** How can you tell?
- **SIOBHAN:** Look at the plate - no feckin' greens!

sd: *WOODY sits down to eat.*

- **WOODY:** Since you're not going to shift by yourselves, I might as well tell you Maggie's not coming back any time soon. Definitely not tonight.**
- **SIOBHAN:** How do you know that?
- **WOODY:** Trust me, I know, alright?**
- **HELEN:** Have you separated, Woody?

*Beat.*

- **WOODY:** One of us has. Not that it's any of your bloody business.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Uh oh.
- **LOUISE:** What have you done with her?
- **WOODY:** I haven't done anything with her! She left last night. Short notice.**

# Page 46

- **LOUISE:** She's not answering her cell phone.
- **WOODY:** She'll have it off.**
- **ANNABEL:** Yesterday morning she was all set to take our workshop. There were no indications-
- **WOODY:** Like I said, short notice.**
- **LOUISE:** Now she's disappeared.
- **WOODY:** She hasn't disappeared. I don't know where she is, but she hasn't disappeared. We had a bit of an argument. End of.**
- **HELEN:** Did you throw your toys, Woody?

*Beat.*

- **WOODY:** A bit.**
- **ANNABEL:** At her?
- **WOODY:** She ducked.**
- **ANNABEL:** Violence is not okay. Never okay.
- **SIOBHAN:** Says so on the telly.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, yeah, I know. It was a pretty even fight, though.**
- **ANNABEL:** Were there children in the house?
- **WOODY:** What? No.**
- **ANNABEL:** (*Grabbing the calendar*) This is what comes from objectifying women: power, control and ultimately violence.
- **WOODY:** Hey, what the hell are you doing with my calendar?**
- **ANNABEL:** Oh, do I have something of yours, Woody? Does that make you feel a bit angry, does it? Maybe you'd like to throw your plate at me? To teach me a lesson?
- **WOODY:** Yeah, I would, actually.**

# Page 47

- **ANNABEL:** Is that a threat? Are you getting your jollies by threatening me?
- **SIOBHAN:** Hang on, Annabel. Calm down. He's just winding you up. 
- **WOODY:** Listen, I didn't ask for all this. I didn't invite you all over here to go touching my stuff, taking shit off the walls. Now I'm not even allowed to get pissed off, in my own frickin' house?** 
- **HELEN:** Point taken, Woody.
- **SIOBHAN:** Look, do you have any idea where Maggie might have gone off to so we can get in touch and sort this out?
- **ANNABEL:** Women's Refuge. She'll be in a safe house somewhere.
- **WOODY:** Aw, bollocks she will.**
- **ANNABEL:** Bollocks, is it? Where else do you think a battered wife feels safe to go except into hiding?
- **WOODY:** I've seen a hot dog more battered than Maggie.**
- **SIOBHAN:** You did throw something at her.
- **WOODY:** It was a loaf of Tip Top! Sandwich slice. And she ducked!**
- **ANNABEL:** That's not the point! It doesn't matter what it is, you acted in an aggressive manner and I'd say that was just the tip of the iceberg, wouldn't you?

*Beat.*
sd: *WOODY gives up and eats his sausages.*

- **SIOBHAN:** So, what now?
- **HELEN:** Well, I'd say the Pink Hammer Workshop is dead in the water.
- **ANNABEL:** Thanks to him.
- **LOUISE:** Perhaps we should just leave.

# Page 48

- **ANNABEL:** Or report him.
- **HELEN:** I think that would be Maggie's call.
- **ANNABEL:** She'll be too traumatised to know what to do.
- **HELEN:** We don't actually have all the facts.
- **ANNABEL:** Well, I for one think if the money we paid Maggie in advance was useful in activating her escape plan, then it was money well spent.
- **SIOBHAN:** Easy for you to say, but three hundred bucks up front was a bit of a stretch for me.
- **LOUISE:** And me, I'm afraid. I'm between jobs at the moment.
- **HELEN:** Well, then, perhaps the honourable thing would be for WOODY to kindly refund us on behalf of his wife.

sd: *They all look to WOODY.*

- **WOODY:** You have got to be joking.**
- **SIOBHAN:** It's because of you that Maggie's left and we're now out of pocket.
- **ANNABEL:** You owe us and you owe Maggie.
- **WOODY:** I didn't take your money! She did. Get it off her!**
- **HELEN:** I'm assuming you know something about carpentry.
- **WOODY:** Of course I bloody do. I'm a carpenter!**
- **HELEN:** Well, why don't you fill in for her? Until she returns. That way no one is out of pocket. We get what we want, and you get to make amends.
- **WOODY:** Amends for what? No frickin' way. Nup. That ain't happening. End of.**

# Page 49

- **ANNABEL:** That's not a bad idea actually, Helen. Not that I would relish spending time with this man under normal circumstances-
- **WOODY:** The feeling is mutual, lady.**
- **ANNABEL:** But if it meant that he paid for his actions ..
- **LOUISE:** You mean a sort of round-about way of donating to Women's Refuge?
- **WOODY:** Shit! How many times? She won't be at the bloody Women's Refuge! You don't know Maggie. She's not afraid of shit. Two of her brothers are patched up and they're even scared of her.**
- **ANNABEL:** Maggie is tangata whenua? People of the land?
- **WOODY:** Actually Horowhenua. Land of horror.**
- **ANNABEL:** Well, regardless, there's no way the courts will get justice for Maggie. They never do. He'll end up with home detention and will continue to sit around here smoking dope without any inconvenience at all. But let me tell you, Woody, that when I find Maggie, and I will find her, I will use all my professional skills to support her in laying charges against you for assault.
- **SIOBHAN:** Come on, Woody. We're not such a bad bunch and supper will be provided.
- **HELEN:** Not from me it won't.

*Beat.*

- **WOODY:** Get stuffed.**
- **HELEN:** Oh, Woody. I hate to be a pain in the arse and I don't really care about the money, my circumstances are slightly different, but I do know it's one thing having a bit of dope for recreational use, but cultivating for supply is looked on as quite a different matter.

*WOODY looks at her hard.*

# Page 50

- **HELEN:** Dirt on your hands? Tripping over Siobhan's bike because you were coming from behind the shed, not up the drive? What say we were to take a little stroll back there, hmm? See what you have hidden?
- **LOUISE:** Or buried!
- **WOODY:** Nothing's buried. This is bullshit.**
- **HELEN:** So, it's just your horticultural skills you don't want us to see?

sd: *HELEN moves towards the door.*

- **WOODY:** (*Leaps up*) Alright! Bloody women. Eyes in the back of your bloody heads. So, what are you going to do about it?**
- **HELEN:** Depends. You're not giving us much choice, but if you could just be a little more co-operative.
- **ANNABEL:** Can we really overlook criminal offending on this scale?
- **SIOBHAN:** Shush.
- **LOUISE:** Doesn't that make us accessories?
- **SIOBHAN:** Only if we match our handbags with our shoes.
- **HELEN:** It's a one-time offer, Woody.
- **WOODY:** Jesus. This is blackmail. And it's not what you're thinking. It's actually for people who are sick and that. I'm not a dealer. It's medicinal.**

sd: *SIOBHAN snorts.*

- **WOODY:** It is! What would you know?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Alright, alright, keep the lid on your bread box.
- **WOODY:** I don't know what's happened here! It's like - this is not my life. Where have you people come from? Why has my marriage got anything to do with you lot?**

# Page 51

- **SIOBHAN:** So, what's it to be then?
- **WOODY:** Alright. Whatever. Jesus, you're a pain in the arse, the lot of you.**

*Beat.*

- **WOODY:** I'll take your stupid workshop till Maggie gets back. But you leave everything else out of it, okay? And we do it my way. I don't want all this aggro, (To ANNABEL) so you can just back off. I don't want any snooping around my place inside or out or taking stuff off my walls.**

sd: *He snatches up his calendar.*

- **WOODY:** Deal?**
- **HELEN:** Deal.
- **WOODY:** I don't know shit about pink hammers, and 'empowerment' sounds like something I'd plug my drill into. But I taught Mags well enough for her to get her feet under a foreman's table, so I must know something. Christ. I can't believe I'm saying this. Have any of you used tools before?**

sd: *Various affirmative replies of 'a bit', etc.*

- **WOODY:** Right. So, tell me, what were you hoping to get out of this?**
- **ANNABEL:** I fancied making a Victorian-styled bookcase. To house my Dickens collection. And I'd like to learn the necessary skills in an environment that positively encourages women.
- **WOODY:** (*Groans*) Whatever. (*Looks at LOUISE*) Next?**
- **LOUISE:** I don't really have a thing I want to make, but Mother's house has to be sold to pay for her rest home care, so I thought if I could do some repairs - replace rotten boards, windowsills, etcetera - it would save her some money.

# Page 52

- **WOODY:** Great. Next.**
- **SIOBHAN:** A doghouse, but not just any doghouse. Top of the range Hilton-for-hounds affair. All the bells and whistles.
- **WOODY:** Genius. Next.**
- **ANNABEL:** What sort of dog do you have, Siobhan?
- **SIOBHAN:** Not me exactly, but my boss has one.
- **WOODY:** You want a kennel for your boss's dog?**
- **HELEN:** Make of that what you will, folks.
- **SIOBHAN:** You see I work at City Vets on Pitt Street-
- **ANNABEL:** I've never seen you there. That's where I take Miss Havisham, my miniature schnauzer.
- **WOODY:** (*Aside*) Nose to tail, one bitch following another.**
- **SIOBHAN:** I only just started. Anyway, I work on reception, and Martin - oh, my God - one of the vets, have you ever seen that man's hands?
- **HELEN:** I've seen them disappear up to the elbow turning a foal.
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, stop it, I'lI feckin' die. Anyway, he has these amazing hands. You know a cat will be going ballistic and he just holds the moggie's head and puts his hands on its neck - the cat just melts. What I'd give to be that cat.
- **ANNABEL:** Subdued into submission?
- **SIOBHAN:** Willingly. Anyway, he's often out of town and he can't always take Rolleston with him, so I thought, what if I could offer him somewhere warm and cosy to house his labradoodle?
- **ANNABEL:** He's married, though. Why can't his wife take care of the dog?

# Page 53

- **SIOBHAN:** Sometimes she decides to travel with him, if she's got nothing better to do. And he'd rather she didn't, trust me. He's not happy at home, you can just tell. What that man needs is -
- **ANNABEL:** Someone half his age for a bit on the side?
- **SIOBHAN:** He's not that old, and anyway, nothing's happened yet. Well, nothing major. We just enjoy a laugh, you know?
- **WOODY:** Anyway ... Next.**
- **HELEN:** I don't know if this is possible or not but-
- **WOODY:** Why wouldn't it be possible? Of course it's possible. It's all possible and positively empowering. 'I am woman hear me snore!'**
- **ANNABEL:** Just ignore the poster boy for domestic violence here, Helen.
- **HELEN:** The dentist last week said to me he can do a repair that lasts five years and costs four hundred dollars, or a crown which lasts twenty years and costs fifteen hundred dollars. But how do I know how long the rest of me will last? Have I got twenty years?
- **LOUISE:** So, what did you decide?
- **HELEN:** After a quick chat with my oncologist, I decided on the cheaper option. Then I decided to do this course and make my own coffin.

*Beat.*

- **HELEN:** Anyway, there you have it, Woody. What can you do for us?
- **WOODY:** Well, what the hell are we waiting for?**

sd: *WOODY sees the tub of butter, sees his chisel, grabs it.*

- **WOODY:** (*Yelling*) Who the hell put butter on my chisel?**

*Lights down.*

# Page 54

## Scene Two

*Lights up, music.*
sd: *WOODY is alone on stage, wearing a carpenter's apron. We see him setting up workstations. There is a knock on the door and HELEN pokes her head around.*

- **HELEN:** So, is it on then?
- **WOODY:** You're early.**
- **HELEN:** I figured if you'd changed your mind I'd still have time to go to a movie.
- **WOODY:** Don't have much choice, do I?**

sd: *HELEN enters.*

- **HELEN:** No Maggie, I take it?
- **WOODY:** Nup.**

sd: *WOODY goes back to setting up. HELEN takes off her jacket.*

- **WOODY:** Hey, how did you know about- you know, round the back?**
- **HELEN:** I didn't. I was bluffing. You had dirt on your hands, roaches in the ashtray, so I took a punt.
- **WOODY:** Shit.**

*Beat.*

- **WOODY:** Just a couple of plants, you know.**
- **HELEN:** I'm not judging. I enjoy the odd toke now and again.
- **WOODY:** True?**
- **HELEN:** It helps when nothing else works. Medicinal, like you said. I wouldn't have called the police you know. Not my style, but I wasn't sure we'd get a refund from Maggie and it seemed to matter to Siobhan and Louise. That's the only reason I said it.

# Page 55

- **WOODY:** Yeah well, picking up after Mags is nothing new.**
- **HELEN:** What do you mean?
- **WOODY:** Nothing.**
- **HELEN:** Why didn't you just pull them up? Destroy the evidence.
- **WOODY:** What and let you win?**
- **HELEN:** Well, I can't imagine you really want us back here.
- **WOODY:** Was hoping she'd have come home by now, then she could sort this shit out herself.**
- **HELEN:** So, you want her back?

sd: *WOODY shrugs.*

- **WOODY:** Yeah, probably.**
- **HELEN:** You don't sound too sure.
- **WOODY:** The dishes are stacking up, so yeah. Joking. Nah, but I do want her back - idiot that I am. She's a hard dog to keep on the porch, though.**

*Beat.*
- **WOODY:** You married?**
- **HELEN:** No, never saw the need.
- **WOODY:** Need?**
- **HELEN:** Financial or otherwise. I've always liked my independence.
- **WOODY:** Uh huh.**
- **HELEN:** The most faithful relationships I've ever had have been with horses. There's no bullshit, no politics.
- **WOODY:** No sex either.**
- **HELEN:** That's what jockeys are for.

# Page 56

- **WOODY:** So, what, you just hang around racetracks, looking for fun?**
- **HELEN:** Mostly the fun comes to me. Well, it used to, when the stables was in its heyday.
- **WOODY:** What stables?**
- **HELEN:** Larkview.
- **WOODY:** Shit, Larkview Stud? That yours?**
- **HELEN:** Family business. These days I mostly buy and syndicate.
- **WOODY:** You've had some big players over the years out of Larkview.**
- **HELEN:** We used to be busy. You follow racing?
- **WOODY:** I like a bet now and again.**

sd: *WOODY continues arranging workstations.*

- **HELEN:** So, do you work in the building industry?
- **WOODY:** Yeah, but got made redundant three months ago. Not much in the way of building work in Palmy at the moment. Not much in the way of anything.**
- **HELEN:** Have you thought about Christchurch, must be work down there?
- **WOODY:** I've got enough earthquake damage in my own life. Been living on a fault line for the last four years.**
- **HELEN:** I guess that's one way of describing marriage.

sd: *SIOBHAN enters wheeling her bike.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Hiya. Oh, yay, we're on then, are we? How you doing, Helen? Alright?
- **HELEN:** Fine, thanks.
- **SIOBHAN:** Nice pinny, Woody.

# Page 57

- **WOODY:** Don't bring that in here.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Well, I don't want you breaking your neck, sneaking round the back of the shed if you get desperate later. Where would you like me to stick it?
- **WOODY:** I've got a three-word answer for that.**
- **SIOBHAN:** What a welcome. I see your mood's not improved over the week.
- **WOODY:** Put it wherever. Just out of the way.**

sd: *SIOBHAN goes to move her bike outside.* *LOUISE arrives with a picnic basket.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Hiya, Louise.
- **LOUISE:** Hi. The workshop's still on then?
- **SIOBHAN:** Yep. Let me just get this out of your way.

sd: *SIOBHAN exits.* *LOUISE enters the workshop.*

- **LOUISE:** Hi all.
- **HELEN:** Hi.

sd: *LOUISE takes off her coat. We hear the sound of metal being scraped against the metal of WOODY's car.*

- **SIOBHAN:** (*Off*) Oh, shiit.

sd: *WOODY registers what the sound means and races out.*

- **HELEN:** Oops.
- **WOODY:** (*Off*) What the fuck are you doing?**
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Off*) I'm sorry, look it's only little... you can hardly-
- **WOODY:** (*Off*) Aw shit. (*Yelling*) Look at that!**

# Page 58

- **SIOBHAN:** (*Off*) I said I'm sorry.
- **WOODY:** (*Off*) Move it will ya, just move it, ya stupid-**
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Off*) I'm trying to! If you would just get out of my bloody way.

sd: *WOODY enters and goes and slumps in his chair, head in hands.* *SIOBHAN enters.*

- **SIOBHAN:** It was an accident, okay?
- **WOODY:** Yeah, well there's accidents and then there's being careless.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Is that what your mother said when you were born?

sd: *WOODY gives her a filthy look.*

-sd:  **SIOBHAN:** Oh, come on. It's not the end of the world.

sd: *WOODY grunts, gets up and carries on organising the workstations.*

- **LOUISE:** (*Tentatively*) I take it there's no news then, Woody?
- **WOODY:** What? Apart from Irish slicing my car door in half?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, for God's sake. It's a tiny scratch. Stop being a drama queen.
- **LOUISE:** I meant about Maggie.
- **WOODY:** Nup.**
- **LOUISE:** Did you hear back from her, Siobhan?
- **SIOBHAN:** Nope. Tried again yesterday and the message said the number no longer exists.
- **LOUISE:** What? What do you think has happened to her phone?
- **SIOBHAN:** Ditched it, I guess. Got a new number.

sd: *SIOBHAN's phone rings.*

# Page 59

- **SIOBHAN:** Talk of the devil. This might be her now, probably heard WOODY screaming like a Kilkenny cat from the other side of Palmy.

sd: *SIOBHAN gets her phone out and looks at the number.*

- **SIOBHAN** Aha, not Maggie, but another devil of sorts. (*Answering the phone*)

- **SIOBHAN** Hiya, Sexy.

sd: *SIOBHAN heads outside to take the call.*
sd: *WOODY gets out bits of wood from a bin of offcuts upstage.*

- **LOUISE:** (*Whispers to HELEN*) So, Maggie really is missing, isn't she? Shouldn't we be worried about that? How do we know if it's dope out there, he could be trying to put us off the scent?
- **HELEN:** I really doubt it.
- **WOODY:** What's with all the whispering? Like being back in fourth form. Right, let's start. (*Calls off*) Siobhan, get in here!**
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Off*) Hang on!
- **WOODY:** Sooner we get on, sooner we can all go home.**
- **HELEN:** This is your home.
- **WOODY:** You'd think. (*Calls*) Lets go, Irish!**
- **SIOBHAN:** Coming!

sd: *She enters still on the phone.*

- **SIOBHAN:** You're a wicked man, Dr Dolittle, or should that be Dr Do-A-Lot. (*Laughing*) Look, I have to go, alright, yeah. Text or call if you can. Sure, bye. (*Hangs up*) Right, Woody, you have my full and undivided attention.
- **WOODY:** Good. (*He throws SIOBHAN her helmet*) Because you left this behind last week.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, I wondered where that had got to. Can't say I missed it. You end up looking like a right knobhead when you take this thing off.

# Page 60

- **WOODY:** Better a knobhead than brain-dead.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Aw, it's nice to know you care.
- **WOODY:** I just don't like you leaving your shit around my place, alright?**
- **SIOBHAN:** And he's back.
- **WOODY:** Whatever. Okay this week we're going to start-**
- **LOUISE:** Um, do you think we should wait for Annabel, so you won't be repeating yourself?
- **WOODY:** Is she coming?**
- **LOUISE:** I assume so. Unless she's disappeared too.
- **WOODY:** I wish. I was hoping I'd put her off.**
- **HELEN:** That would be like trying to stop the tide. She's on a roll to reform you.
- **SIOBHAN:** She's got you in her sights, Woodman.
- **WOODY:** Well, she's late, so tough titties. Right, after last week's efforts I figured we'd better go back to the basics. Now, you lot gave me a lot of bullshit about what experience you'd had so I'm asking again - have any of you honestly banged a nail in straight or screwed something to a wall before?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Honestly no, but I'm open to offers.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, that's the rumour I've heard.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Humour! Who would have thought?
- **WOODY:** Results from last week.**

sd: *He gets some lame bits of carpentry out of the bin. They fall apart, etc.*

- **WOODY:** Your vet will be suing you for damages if you put anything like that near his labradoodle.**

# Page 61

- **SIOBHAN:** You threw some wood at me and gave me ten minutes -what do you expect?
- **WOODY:** The rest of you couldn't even get that far. So, look around you, I've set up workstations. I'll show you what you need to do and then you all can move around from station to station.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, like a pilgrimage.
- **LOUISE:** What?
- **SIOBHAN:** Stations of the Cross, it's a pilgrimage and you pray at each station.

sd: *WOODY has moved to the first workstation.*

- **WOODY:** Okay, the basics. Hammering in a nail.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Jesus is condemned to death.
- **WOODY:** (*Looks at SIOBHAN, then demonstrates*) Goes like this. To remove the nail, you go like this. Simple. Repeat that a few times. Then I want you to use this, it's a stud finder-**
- **SIOBHAN:** I've got that app on my phone.
- **WOODY:** You use it like this. (*He demonstrates on a wall*) That way if you're hanging up a picture or something you know you're nailing into something solid.**
- **HELEN:** Can't you just knock along the wall? (*She demonstrates*)
- **WOODY:** You lot wouldn't know what you were listening for. Right, next, moving onto drilling a hole.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Jesus falls for the first time.
- **LOUISE:** Aw.
- **HELEN:** The dangers of drilling a hole I suspect.
- **SIOBHAN:** Ha! Very good.

# Page 62

- **WOODY:** This is your drill and that's the bit, this is how you put it in, and you hold it like this.**
- **SIOBHAN:** And what would we be needing to drill a hole for, Woody?
- **WOODY:** It's a preparatory hole.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Preparatory for what?
- **WOODY:** Well, you don't want a tight screw in a hole that won't take it.**
- **SIOBHAN:** No, Woody, you certainly don't!

sd: *WOODY drills a hole.*

- **WOODY:** There you go. So, drill some holes. (*Moves to next workstation*) Now, screwing.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Jesus meets his mother.
- **HELEN:** Very Freudian.
- **SIOBHAN:** True enough.
- **WOODY:** Here's a range of screws and screwdrivers, first find the right screw and the right size.**
- **SIOBHAN:** If only it was that easy. I never knew woodwork could sound so sexy.
- **WOODY:** Moving on. Practise putting these hinges on two bits of wood - I've pre-drilled holes for you - then take them off.**
- **HELEN:** Why can't we just use the Black & Decker over there?
- **WOODY:** You don't move onto power tools until you can get a handle on the basics.**
- **HELEN:** Power tools are meant to make life easier.
- **SIOBHAN:** Why they were invented.

# Page 63

- **WOODY:** They're my power tools. I say when you use them.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Yes, sir!
- **LOUISE:** To be honest, the idea of using power tools seems a bit dangerous for me as a learner and they make a lot of noise, don't they? I'm happy to be starting with the basics, if no one else minds? Sorry.

sd: *There's a knock at the door. ANNABEL enters, taking off her coat as she speaks.*

- **ANNABEL:** Apologies, apologies. Work emergency. I got held up with a very needy client. Had to get him stable - addiction issues, so it's always a compromise, isn't it? One step forward, two steps back, but at the end of the day they have to take responsibility for their actions.
- **SIOBHAN:** Bit hard if you're out of it.
- **ANNABEL:** Then don't be out of it. You have a choice. The light bulb has got to want to change, and this client has had all the advantages of an excellent family upbringing and support so really there's no excuse. No excuse. Anyway, enough of that. Nice to see you've come on board, Woody. Doing your community service as it were. Has anyone heard from Maggie?
- **LOUISE:** No, and her phone number no longer exists.
- **ANNABEL:** Oh. (*Glares at WOODY*) And I wonder whose fault that is? I suspect Prince Charming here has been text bombing and harassing her with calls. Am I right?

sd: *Silence from WOODY.*

- **ANNABEL:** But there is help, if you're willing. Here, all the information you need.

sd: *She takes pamphlets from her bag and hands them to WOODY.*

# Page 64

- **ANNABEL:** Men Against Violence: anger management, cognitive therapy.. I recommend you get in touch, and I hope for all our sakes you do. Right. And remember, ladies, we are here for Maggie, ourselves and to reclaim the night.
- **HELEN:** Wow. That takes me back. Very seventies.
- **ANNABEL:** Sadly true, and so little has changed after all we fought for.
- **SIOBHAN:** I wasn't born in the seventies. What, exactly, were you fighting for?
- **ANNABEL:** Autonomy, Siobhan, you really should learn some feminist history. To live without fear of violence just because you're a woman and to be what you want to be rather than what is dictated to you by the patriarchy. I sometimes wonder where all that fight has got us, though, when you hear of thirteen-year-old girls getting Brazilians. Honestly, it makes me want to weep - I don't mean to go on, but when something presses my button, I'm off.
- **WOODY:** (*Quietly*) Where's the button?**
- **ANNABEL:** Anyway, here we all are doing something positive and at the same time educating Woody, so all is not lost. I think we might have come into your life for a reason - if you like to think of it that way. (She puts down her bag) So, let's roll up our sleeves and get on with it. Now, what have I missed?
- **LOUISE:** We're just up to 'Jesus becomes unhinged'.
- **ANNABEL:** Riiight.
- **WOODY:** Workstations, we're going round, learning the basics.**
- **LOUISE:** It's like a confidence course.
- **HELEN:** For kids.
- **SIOBHAN:** Woodwork for dummies.

# Page 65

- **WOODY:** Hey, if you all think you know so much-**
- **SIOBHAN:** Calm down, we're only joking.
- **ANNABEL:** Small steps, that's a good start. Helen's probably just concerned about time, aren't you, Helen?
- **HELEN:** Time?
- **ANNABEL:** Yes, 'time's winged chariot. (*In a hushed concerned tone*) How have you been feeling?
- **LOUISE:** Sorry, I completely forgot. Yes, how are you feeling?
- **SIOBHAN:** She looks grand to me.

*Beat.*

- **HELEN:** Okay, let's get this cleared up right now. My health is the same as last week and will very probably be the same next week. Any one of you could drop off the perch before me. I don't want to have some sort of 'encounter group' every time I turn up here, okay. So, can we just move on?
- **ANNABEL:** Of course. But here, I brought you this to borrow - (She takes a book from her bag) Kübler-Ross, an oldie but a goodie for later.
- **SIOBHAN:** (*To LOUISE*) Her handbag's like Santa's sack, isn't it?
- **HELEN:** Thank you, Annabel. You really are something.
- **ANNABEL:** It's nothing, it's what I'm trained to do. If anything, Helen, it's a privilege.

sd: *She takes HELEN's hand and squeezes it.*

- **ANNABEL:** WOODY can't be expected to facilitate the empowering of women when his understanding is so-
- **WOODY:** So, what?**
- **ANNABEL:** Without wanting to use labels, I would say limited or fledgling. But if he expects Maggie to return, he'll have to do an attitudinal three-sixty-degree turnabout.

# Page 66

sd: *WOODY looks daggers at ANNABEL. He moves to the next workstation upstage.*

- **LOUISE:** (*Whispers to SIOBHAN*) Doesn't three hundred and sixty degrees mean he will end up exactly where he started?
- **WOODY:** Next station, sawing. This is a handsaw, it's sharp. Hold it like this, keep your fingers like this, you make a groove to start, then continue like this. (Demonstrates) Keep your weight on it though, like this. (Demonstrates) Right, spread out, find a station, when I tell you to move, move in a clockwise direction. Now go.**

sd: *The women look around and choose a station. LOUISE and SIOBHAN are together with the hammer and drill at the front of the stage. HELEN takes the screwdriver station and ANNABEL the handsaw at the back of the stage.*

- **WOODY:** And begin!**

sd: *The women start their tasks. SIOBHAN starts with the hammer; she is really good.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Ta-da!
- **LOUISE:** Wow, you make that look simple.
- **SIOBHAN:** He's taking the piss making us do this. We're not disabled. Anyway, after running with a keg for eight k's on the weekend, I should be swinging a mallet.

sd: *SIOBHAN removes the nail and starts again.*

- **LOUISE:** Oh, that's right, how did you get on? Am I doing this right, just turning the handle?
- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah, you seem to be making a hole. We came fifth.
- **LOUISE:** How many teams were there?
- **SIOBHAN:** Five. But we cleaned up in the pub after - a mighty effort by the Paddies.

# Page 67

- **LOUISE:** This is just like using an egg-beater, isn't it.
- **SIOBHAN:** Monday I felt sick as a dog, but Martin-
- **LOUISE:** With the lovely hands?
- **SIOBHAN:** Precisely. He'd promised I could watch him pop out a moggie's eyeball. He likes to impress me with things like that. I nearly brought up my breakfast. But Louise, last night, oh, my God.
- **LOUISE:** What happened?
- **SIOBHAN:** We're all on, Louise! It was amazing. We were closing up and we both reached for the door handle at the same time, the lights were out, and somehow we found ourselves getting all hot and heavy on a stack of Eukanuba. We split the feckin' bag.
- **LOUISE:** But he's married.
- **SIOBHAN:** He is at the moment.
- **LOUISE:** What if she finds out?
- **SIOBHAN:** But she's not going to, is she? Right, stud finder time.

sd: *SIOBHAN pretends to be drawn to WOODY like a magnet before she uses the stud finder on the wall to locate a stud.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Found it!
- **WOODY:** Next station.**
- **ANNABEL:** I'm not even halfway through the sawing!
- **WOODY:** Next station!**
- **LOUISE:** Shall we just swap places, Siobhan?
- **SIOBHAN:** Sure thing.

sd: *The women move round. SIOBHAN moves to drilling, LOUISE to hammering, HELEN goes up to the sawing post. ANNABEL also goes to the hammer.*

# Page 68

- **LOUISE:** Do you mind? We just swapped places.
- **ANNABEL:** I thought we were meant to move in a circle.
- **SIOBHAN:** Just jump to Jesus becomes unhinged'. Or you can have Jesus falls for the first time if you like.
- **ANNABEL:** I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- **WOODY:** (*Calling out*) Everyone move clockwise, how hard can it be?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Listen, it's not a concentration camp, you know!
- **WOODY:** That's bloody obvious.**
- **HELEN:** (*Starts sawing*) He's just grumpy because he's not getting his oats.
- **WOODY:** I heard that!**
- **HELEN:** You were meant to!
- **ANNABEL:** I'll go over here, not worth worrying about. We're just screwing in these hinges, are we? I don't understand why we're putting them into ready-made holes?

sd: *WOODY moves over to ANNABEL.*

- **WOODY:** Well, let's see you give it a whirl without the hole then.**
- **LOUISE:** I can't seem to hold the nail and hit it.
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, I just remembered something.

sd: *She goes over to get a comb from her handbag.*

- **ANNABEL:** It's actually quite hard to do this.
- **WOODY:** No shit, Sherlock. Now do you understand why we pre-drill some holes first?**
- **HELEN:** Unless, of course, you're allowed to use an electric drill. Then it's easy as.

# Page 69

- **ANNABEL:** Power tools next week, is it?
- **SIOBHAN:** Here's how you hold the nail. I remember my grandad showing me this. Trick of the trade. (*Puts the nail in the comb*) Have a go now.

sd: *LOUISE hammers a large nail in.*

- **LOUISE:** Woody, look at this ingenious idea of Siobhan's. You use a comb.
- **SIOBHAN:** More than just a pretty face.

sd: *LOUISE hammers home the nail. WOODY picks up the bit of wood with the comb nailed on and tries to get the comb off.*

- **WOODY:** Genius.**
- **LOUISE:** Sorry, Siobhan.
- **SIOBHAN:** No worries.

sd: *SIOBHAN takes it from WOODY and tries to remove the comb. WOODY puts on his industrial ear protectors and sits with his 'Best Bets' and a pen.*

- **LOUISE:** Right. Stud finding.
- **HELEN:** (*Comes over to the hammer station*) I've finished with sawing.
- **ANNABEL:** I've finished this too. Shall we swap, Siobhan?
- **SIOBHAN:** Yep sure.

sd: *ANNABEL starts on the drilling station beside HELEN on the hammer.*

- **ANNABEL:** WOODY looks like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders, doesn't he? Separation is extremely stressful. I've been through it, but luckily, I met my second husband Lindsey within a year so things fell back into place.
- **HELEN:** When was that?
- **ANNABEL:** Going on sixteen years ago. My son Angus had just started school.

# Page 70

- **LOUISE:** I'm a bit nervous about this sawing.
- **SIOBHAN:** You'll be fine.
- **ANNABEL:** Do you have children?
- **HELEN:** Two boys, both in their late twenties now. One's in the States, the other's in Dubai.
- **ANNABEL:** Oh, that sounds adventurous. You must be proud of them.
- **HELEN:** For what? Living overseas?
- **ANNABEL:** Well, yes, in a way. Being independent, out in the world.
- **HELEN:** It's what I always assumed they'd do.
- **ANNABEL:** Yes of course, but it's something to be proud of. I would have liked more children, but Angus was a rather exacting child and I didn't want to put extra strain on my new relationship. Not fair on Lindsey as it was, coping with all of Angus's issues.
- **HELEN:** He had issues at age five?

sd: *LOUISE has finished with stud finding and is at the saw.*

- **LOUISE:** Could someone start me off do you think? Woody?
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Shouts*) Woody? (*To LOUISE*) Oh, give it here.

sd: *SIOBHAN goes over to help LOUISE, then drifts back to HELEN and*
sd: *ANNABEL downstage.*

- **ANNABEL:** Angus has an anxiety disorder. Which manifests itself in compulsive behaviour. He was hoarding even before he went to school.
- **HELEN:** Kids love collecting stuff.
- **ANNABEL:** Rubbish? Leaves, rocks, empty boxes. His father was the same with fishing rods. I mean how many do you need? He used to take Gussy out of preschool if the weather was fine to go fishing with him.

# Page 71

- **SIOBHAN:** Sounds educational.
- **ANNABEL:** Preschool is educational. Montessori was working well, he was settling down, his art was coming along. Angus is very gifted, but you need to keep at him. Of course, ultimately, 1 blame myself. I took my eye off the ball because I was so busy studying. Lindsey's been a brilliant stepfather. We're very big on respect for women in our household. Unlike some.

sd: *WOODY takes off his earmuffs and goes to the door muttering.*

- **WOODY:** Poor bloody bastard.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oi, where are you going?
- **WOODY:** To buy a better pair of muffs.**
- **ANNABEL:** Woody, as you're going out, I wonder if you wouldn't mind moving your car so I could park mine in the carport. My husband's nervous about it being on the street in this neighbourhood. Thank you.

sd: *WOODY exits.*

- **ANNABEL:** What about your husband, Helen?
- **HELEN:** I brought the boys up on my own.
- **ANNABEL:** Oh, that must have been hard. I had Gussy on my own for less than a year and I found it very challenging.
- **HELEN:** I was lucky I guess. I could afford boarding school for them, and the horses made great babysitters. Never really had to do much once they learned to ride.
- **ANNABEL:** Was their father actively involved in their lives?
- **HELEN:** Fathers, plural.
- **ANNABEL:** Oh, I see.
- **HELEN:** And no, they weren't.

*Beat.*

# Page 72

sd: *LOUISE has sawn through the saw horse, which collapses.*

- **LOUISE:** Oh, help! They all laugh.
- **ANNABEL:** Shall we have a break? I've brought the eats this week.
- **HELEN:** I knew someone would.
- **SIOBHAN:** We only just started.
- **ANNABEL:** Woody's meant to be teaching us, so he should at least be in the room. Look what Louise has done.

sd: *ANNABEL goes to her bag. SIOBHAN has got the saw horse standing.*

- **SIOBHAN:** He'll never notice.
- **LOUISE:** I've brought a little something too. (*She goes to her bag*)
- **ANNABEL:** But you did last week.
- **LOUISE:** Well, we don't have to have it, it'll keep, I'll just ... (*She puts it away apologetically*)
- **SIOBHAN:** So, is there a supper roster or something?
- **HELEN:** No, there is not.

sd: *HELEN goes and sits in the armchair and looks at 'Best Bets'.*

- **ANNABEL:** Helen, you funny old thing - no one's judging you, honestly. I've just made ginger crunch, it's such an easy-peasy recipe, took no time at all.
- **HELEN:** It's no wonder it's not women who start wars, isn't it. They're too busy baking a caramel slice to take to the front before the first shots are fired.
- **ANNABEL:** That's a good thing, who wants wars?
- **LOUISE:** I brought a little something for Woody, in case he was still on his own. A casserole for the freezer. You don't think that's too much, do you? (She takes a casserole out of her basket)

# Page 73

- **ANNABEL:** More than he deserves but very kind of you.
- **SIOBHAN:** You're on your own - does anyone make you something for the freezer?
- **LOUISE:** Well, no, but then, why would they? I can cook. I'll just leave it in here for now.

sd: *LOUISE takes out some of WOODY's beers from the fridge and puts them on the bench to make room.*

- **SIOBHAN:** I thought you had WOODY pegged as a murderous villain who'd chopped Maggie into pieces and hidden her under the floorboards?
- **LOUISE:** I never said that! I just thought maybe she'd had an accident. She might have fallen down a cliff or-
- **SIOBHAN:** In Palmy? She'd be lucky.
- **LOUISE:** -or down a ravine lying unconscious somewhere, cold, and her phone running out of battery and who would know?
- **SIOBHAN:** Not the impression I got. I thought you were just itching to check his hammer for blood, matted hair, bits of brain-
- **ANNABEL:** Oh, please. (*Handing out her slice*)
- **SIOBHAN:** You were as suspicious as all hell.
- **LOUISE:** Well, I still think it's odd she never got back to us. Now her number's disconnected. I don't know why you're not more concerned.
- **ANNABEL:** She'll be concentrating on survival at the moment. I'm sure she'll be in touch once she has the strength.
- **LOUISE:** You've got the base lovely and crunchy.
- **ANNABEL:** I know. Good, isn't it?
- **SIOBHAN:** Cup of tea wouldn't go amiss.
- **ANNABEL:** Next week I'll bring a thermos. (*Offers a slice*) Helen?

# Page 74

- **HELEN:** Not for me thanks.

sd: *SIOBHAN's phone beeps with a text message. She gets it from her bag and reads it while she eats.*

- **ANNABEL:** (*To HELEN*) Um, I think we started off on the wrong foot last week. I'm sorry about that. I do understand The Dickens Book Club is not to everyone's taste.
- **SIOBHAN:** Ooh, a sexy vet text. A vext!
- **ANNABEL:** I just hope you didn't think the Dickens club was elitist in some way.
- **LOUISE:** Company is a big part of it, isn't it? Making new friends.
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Laughs at her phone*) Oh, now that is seriously filthy. What time do you think we'll finish here? Martin would like some help with, ahem, stocktaking.
- **LOUISE:** Nine I think, but isn't that a bit late for going back to work?
- **ANNABEL:** Louise, really. And I'd rather you didn't make me complicit in this ... affair if you don't mind, Siobhan. Politically it puts me in a very parlous position.
- **SIOBHAN:** (*Sings*) If you're Irish come into the parlour, there's a welcome there for you.

sd: *SIOBHAN texts back.*

- **LOUISE:** I love how you use words, Annabel. Complicit, parlous.
- **ANNABEL:** Literature is a passion of mine. What are you reading at the moment, Helen?
- **HELEN:** (*Holds up racing magazine*) 'Best Bets'.
- **ANNABEL:** No, I mean at home. Really reading.
- **HELEN:** I'm lucky if I finish the paper these days. Anything longer than that, I can't be bothered.

# Page 75

- **ANNABEL:** That's such a shame. Reading can be a great comfort.

*Beat.*

- **HELEN:** I need the loo. (*HELEN gets up out of the chair, a bit unsteady as she walks*) I'll see if the woodman's hospitality extends that far.
- **LOUISE:** See if you can check out all the bedrooms while you're up there. Look in the wardrobes too.
- **HELEN:** Alittle unsubtle, but I'll give it a whirl, Miss Marple.
- **ANNABEL:** And remind him about moving the car, will you?

sd: *HELEN exits.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Poor Helen. Must be scary. Still, she seems well enough.
- **ANNABEL:** She's very proud. She's the type of person who hates the idea of being vulnerable. She never even gave the book club a chance. And we're very nice people.
- **LOUISE:** It's always hanging over you, I suppose. Mortality. Like a black cloud.
- **SIOBHAN:** Hanging over all of us from the day we're born. The trick is not to look up and to keep on the move.
- **ANNABEL:** I think she's quietly terrified. Her sons live overseas, there's no husband. Doesn't sound like she has anyone to talk to. I mean, really? Making her own coffin when she's as rich as Croesus? That's just a cry for help.
- **LOUISE:** This is the first group I've ever belonged to. I never had the evenings free before.
- **SIOBHAN:** Night shift?
- **LOUISE:** In a way. I couldn't leave my parents-well, Dad, really. He had dementia quite early and my mother didn't like to be with him on her own. And then, when he passed away, she needed taking care of. Seems to have gone on for years.

# Page 76

- **SIOBHAN:** What, so you nursed for a job and then nursed your parents at night as well?
- **LOUISE:** I wasn't working as a nurse then. I haven't worked as a proper nurse in a hospital environment for years.
- **SIOBHAN:** How come?
- **LOUISE:** I... found the, um, pressure was ... I found I couldn't. I just wasn't that well-suited, probably.
- **SIOBHAN:** I think you'd make a lovely nurse, totally suited in my opinion.
- **LOUISE:** Well, we only just met last week, so we don't really know each other that well, but thank you.
- **ANNABEL:** That's the marvellous thing about women getting together in a group like this, isn't it? We've all got different backgrounds and life stories to tell, but slowly we get to know each other and bonds are made.
- **SIOBHAN:** And baking is made, which is a plus.
- **LOUISE:** Yes, I'm glad I came back, I nearly didn't.
- **SIOBHAN:** Why? Don't you want to do up your mum's house?
- **LOUISE:** Turns out I don't need to. It's been sold.
- **SIOBHAN:** In a week?
- **LOUISE:** Yes. It was quite a shock to me too, but a friend of Mother's, Alison, did a private sale for her. I had no idea ... It never even went on the market.
- **ANNABEL:** When do you have to move?
- **LOUISE:** Settlement is in seven weeks. So, if anyone knows of a one-bedroom rental? Furnished.
- **SIOBHAN:** Furnished?

# Page 77

- **LOUISE:** Alison included most of the furniture in the sale agreement. Her niece, who's bought the place is coming from the UK so-
- **ANNABEL:** And your mother agreed to all this?
- **LOUISE:** Oh, yes. She's really pleased because she wanted to hang on to her shares and bonus bonds, and this way she won't have to sell them for quite some time. So, that's good.
- **SIOBHAN:** But you're left without a roof over your head.
- **LOUISE:** Well, to be fair to Mother, I was only meant to move in temporarily while I-looked for a job, but well, I never really left.
- **ANNABEL:** But you nursed your parents. That's a job.
- **LOUISE:** It's just what you do, isn't it?
- **SIOBHAN:** Who the hell is this 'Alison'?
- **LOUISE:** Actually, I don't know where Alison came from, she's an age-support volunteer, I think. She just sort of popped up over the last year. Mother calls Alison her 'lifeline'.

sd: *ANNABEL's phone rings.*

- **ANNABEL:** Have you discussed this with a lawyer at all?
- **LOUISE:** Why would I need a lawyer?
- **ANNABEL:** (*On the phone*) Hi.
- **SIOBHAN:** (*To LOUISE*) Well, I hope she's got you in her will.
- **LOUISE:** (*Quietly*) I very much doubt it.
- **ANNABEL:** (*On phone*) Did he say where? Right, what did you say to him? No, no, not this time. No, we stand firm on this. Well, what should I do? What are you suggesting?
- **WOODY:** (*Off*) Oi, Irish!**

sd: *WOODY bangs on the door.*

# Page 78

sd: *SIOBHAN goes over to open it.* *WOODY enters carrying a tray with teacups and a teapot.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, my God. Now that I was not expecting,
- **WOODY:** Not my idea.**
- **ANNABEL:** (*On phone*) Listen - No, you listen-
- **SIOBHAN:** Helen put you up to this? I wonder what she gave you in return?
- **WOODY:** Nothing. Take this, will you? I feel like a dickhead standing here.**

sd: *SIOBHAN takes the tray and LOUISE makes some space.*

- **ANNABEL:** (*On phone*)-hold on, hold on. What do you expect me to do?

sd: *WOODY sees his beers on the bench.*

- **WOODY:** (*Yelling*) Who took my beers out of the bloody fridge?**
- **LOUISE:** Well, I did. I brought you-
- **WOODY:** You do not take a man's beers out of his fridge!**
- **ANNABEL:** (*To WOODY*) Excuse me, I'm trying to have a conversation here.
- **WOODY:** I don't give a shit! And what the hell is this? (*He holds out LOUISE's casserole*)**
- **ANNABEL:** (*On phone*) Lindsey, I just need to take this outside. Keep talking-

sd: *ANNABEL goes outside.*

- **SIOBHAN:** That, Woody, is a dinner that Louise kindly made because she felt sorry for you. You ungrateful sod.
- **WOODY:** You don't take a man's beers out of the fridge.**

# Page 79

- **SIOBHAN:** Big feckin' deal.
- **WOODY:** I've already got one mother, I don't need any more.**
- **LOUISE:** I shouldn't have moved your beers. Sorry, I wasn't thinking,
- **SIOBHAN:** Don't you dare apologise. He's the one who should be apologising (*To WOODY*) Someone somewhere has kept you on a very tight leash, hasn't she? And now we're all under the gun. So, just back off, tiger.

sd: *LOUISE starts to frantically scratch.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Look, you're making her scratch!
- **LOUISE:** No, no, I scratch all the time. I just react to ... um . .. um, I'm hormonally challenged, that's all. I'm fine, fine.

*Beat.*
sd: *WOODY stares at LOUISE who's trying to stop scratching but failing.*

- **WOODY:** Sorry. Shouldn't have shouted. Sorry.**
- **LOUISE:** That's fine. Fine, really. Understandable.

*Beat.*
sd: *WOODY calms down.*

- **WOODY:** Since I made it, does anyone want tea?**
- **SIOBHAN/LOUISE:** Yes, thank you.
- **WOODY:** (*Indicates the teapot*) Fill your boots.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Ah, you Kiwi blokes. You're so damn charming.
- **LOUISE:** I'll be Mother, shall I?

sd: *WOODY reorganises his beers. LOUISE pours the tea.* *HELEN enters.*

# Page 80

- **HELEN:** Our friendly counsellor seems to be having a bit of a meltdown out there.
- **LOUISE:** She was having a very intense conversation in here. With her husband, I think.
- **HELEN:** Talking about having someone sectioned. Maybe it's him. Poor bugger.
- **WOODY:** He probably left the toilet seat up.**
- **LOUISE:** Tea, Helen?
- **HELEN:** Thanks.
- **SIOBHAN:** Hey, how did you persuade the woodman to be Teasmade?
- **WOODY:** I'm very capable of being hospitable when I feel like it.**
- **HELEN:** I gave him a hot tip for the Hastings Spring Classic on Saturday.
- **SIOBHAN:** I knew it!
- **HELEN:** He'd circled some lame nags in 'Best Bets'. Didn't seem fair.
- **SIOBHAN:** Woodman! Drugs, gambling - what other vices are we missing?
- **WOODY:** Ha-bloody-ha. Knowing my luck, it probably won't make it out of the stalls.**
- **HELEN:** Thanks very much. Shelly Bay's one of my girls, she'll make it out.

sd: *They drink their tea. WOODY has a beer in his hand. HELEN is in his chair. He goes and sits on the saw horse - it collapses.*

- **WOODY:** Fucking hell!**
- **LOUISE:** Oh, God...

# Page 81

- **SIOBHAN:** (*Trying not to laugh, covers for LOUISE*) I am so sorry, Woody. My bad. I got carried away. I just don't know my own strength.
- **WOODY:** You've scratched my car, broken my saw horse-**
- **SIOBHAN:** But not your heart, Woody. I promise I'll never break your heart.

sd: *WOODY gives up. He moves the two pieces of the saw horse out of the way. LOUISE mouths 'thank you' to SIOBHAN, who gestures back 'it was nothing' Beat.*

- **LOUISE:** Woody, how hard do you think it would be to build a shed like this?
- **WOODY:** Not hard, if you're a builder.**
- **LOUISE:** Well, I was thinking, this is all you need really, isn't it?
- **WOODY:** You mean to live in?**
- **LOUISE:** Yes, all you need is shelter, somewhere dry - you don't need a whole lot of rooms.
- **HELEN:** You fancy building your own home?
- **LOUISE:** Not a house-house but, you know, something simple. Like this.
- **WOODY:** Practise putting a tent up first, Louise. See how you get on with that.**

sd: *SIOBHAN's phone rings.*

- **WOODY:** I'm going to ban cell phones from the class. Too much bloody chat.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, like you were teaching us anything, sitting on your arse with your earmuffs on. (*Answering the phone*) Hi, you. What's up?

# Page 82

- **LOUISE:** Do you think it would be safe for me to have a flutter on Shelly Bay?
- **HELEN:** Maybe, but I'd say Dream Baby for a place if I was you, Louise.
- **SIOBHAN:** (*On phone*) Are you kidding me? When?
- **WOODY:** What the hell? You told me Shelly Bay was a shoo-in!**
- **HELEN:** Shelly's a diva. She'll either win and win spectacularly, or she'll schlep in last. It's a risk - all depends on her mood.
- **WOODY:** Fan-bloody-tastic.**
- **HELEN:** It's not called gambling for nothing, you know.
- **SIOBHAN:** (*On phone*) Oh, my God. No, of course it was on! Why wouldn't it be on! Oh, holy Jesus, no, I'm coming now. Yeah, yeah, see you in a minute.

sd: *SIOBHAN gathers up her jacket and bag.*

- **SIOBHAN:** There's been a break-in at the clinic. Martin arrived to find the back door bashed in. He's called the cops. He said the alarm wasn't on. But I'm sure I turned it on, why wouldn't I? I'm sure... Oh, Mother of God, what if I didn't? And, of course, the drug cabinet - open and totally cleared out. Oh, God... I'm sure. I'm sure I turned the feckin' thing on. Sorry, everyone, I have to get down there. Martin's going ballistic. See you all later.

sd: *SIOBHAN goes to exit. WOODY grabs her helmet off the floor and throws it to her.*

- **WOODY:** Helmet!**
- **SIOBHAN:** Ta, Mammy. What would I do without you?

sd: ANNABEL enters as SIOBHAN heads out.

- **SIOBHAN:** Sorry, Annabel. Emergency.

sd: SIOBHAN exits.

# Page 83

- **ANNABEL:** What's that about?
- **LOUISE:** There's been a break-in at the clinic.
- **ANNABEL:** Siobhan's just the receptionist though, isn't she?
- **LOUISE:** Seems the alarm may not have been turned on.
- **ANNABEL:** Ooooh. I see. No doubt one of her jobs. Martin Sullivan is not going to be impressed, is he? (*ANNABEL offers her ginger crunch to WOODY*) Slice?
- **WOODY:** Nah, nah, she's right.**
- **ANNABEL:** Oh, well, please yourself.
- **WOODY:** I will.**
- **ANNABEL:** Ah, tea. Well, I have diverted disaster yet again. Staged an intervention. I just wish counselling kept office hours. Still, 'A day wasted on others is not wasted on one's self' Do you know that one, Helen?
- **HELEN:** Haven't a clue.
- **ANNABEL:** 'A Tale of Two Cities'. (*Gives HELEN a 'one point for me' gesture*) And I think you can put your mind to rest about the whereabouts of Maggie, Louise. She's obviously alive and well if she's decided to sell the house.
- **WOODY:** What?**
- **ANNABEL:** I just saw a private sale sign going up-
- **WOODY:** When? Where?**
- **ANNABEL:** Just now, at the end of the drive. I was just checking my car-

sd: *She doesn't have time to finish her sentence before WOODY tears out.*

- **WOODY:** (*Exiting*) You've got to be bloody joking,**
- **ANNABEL:** Obviously the first he's heard of it.

# Page 84

- **LOUISE:** Just like what's happened to me.
- **ANNABEL:** Do we know why she's left him yet? Aside from the obvious.
- **HELEN:** Seems she's got another bloke. He told me in the house. Been going on for over a year but he's only just found out.

sd: *We hear shouting and brouhaha from outside. The women all go up to the back window to have a look.*
sd: *WOODY rushes back in carrying a For Sale sign with a big chunk of lawn attached.*

- **WOODY:** (*Puffed up and exultant*) Game on, Maggie! Game on!**

sd: *Lights down. Music.*

**Act TWO**
**Scene One**

# Page 85

**SCENE ONE**

sd: *The stage is in darkness.* *SIOBHAN knocks and enters cautiously. She is wearing her cycle helmet and reflector vest.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Woody? Woody?

sd: *No answer.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, shite.

sd: *SIOBHAN feels around for a light switch on the wall. She finds it and flicks it on. She sees pieces of cardboard taped together to make the shape of a coffin leaning up against the wall.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Holy Mother of God. That is so creepy.

sd: *SIOBHAN goes up to the window and looks out. Her phone beeps. She finds it in her bag and checks the text.*

sd: - **SIOBHAN:** *(Panic)* No, no. Oh, God!

sd: *SIOBHAN starts to send a text back as she makes her way over to the door.* *LOUISE enters.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, thank God. Have you seen Woody?
- **LOUISE:** No, why?
- **SIOBHAN:** Look, I need you to stay here while I look in the house, okay? Stay here, and if he comes in, make sure he doesn't leave.
- **LOUISE:** Why? What's happened?
- **SIOBHAN:** Can't explain now, just keep him in here, okay?
- **LOUISE:** Okay, right.

# Page 86

sd: *SIOBHAN exits, leaving the door open. LOUISE puts her bag down then sees the coffin cut- out. She tentatively touches it. HELEN pops her head around the door. She's dragging a large sack.*

- **HELEN:** *(Calling)* Hey, Louise.
- **LOUISE:** *(Yelps)* Aaaah! Oh, God.
- **HELEN:** Sorry, didn't mean to give you a fright. What's got into Siobhan? She's running down the drive like a bat out of hell.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, Helen.

sd: *LOUISE goes to the doorway and pulls HELEN into a hug.*

- **HELEN:** *(Slightly mystified by the hug)* O-kay. Look, I've just got a few bags to bring in from the car. You wouldn't mind giving me a hand. She catches the coffin cut out from of the corner of her eye. She goes over to have a proper look.
- **HELEN:** Well, that makes it a bit real, doesn't it? He didn't even measure me.
- **LOUISE:** It was just here when I arrived.
- **HELEN:** No, I'm pleased actually. Looks like he's taking us seriously.

sd: *SIOBHAN enters, breathless.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Now listen quick - Woody is on his way. We have to keep him in here. Maggie rang earlier-
- **LOUISE:** She rang you?
- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah, she had my number from when I called her and left her that message. Look, she's coming over to pick up a few of her things, and we have to keep Woody in here till she gives me the all clear, okay  - What the hell is that smell?

# Page 87

- **HELEN:** Horse shit. A bag each. My equivalent of bringing a plate.
- **SIOBHAN:** For supper?
- **HELEN:** It's the best I can offer.

sd: *HELEN goes and sits in WOODY's chair.*

- **SIOBHAN:** *(Goes up to the back window)* Shite, shite. Oh God, he's coming. *(She gets her phone and dials.)*
- **SIOBHAN:** *(On phone)* Pick up, pick up- Maggie. Yeah, it's me. Roger roger. Yeah, we'll try.

sd: *She puts the phone away as WOODY enters. SIOBHAN goes and shuts the door behind him.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Hello there, Woody, and welcome.
- **WOODY:** And back at you, Siobhan. Ladies, you're early tonight. I must be doing something right.**

sd: *WOODY goes and straps his tool apron on. He sniffs. Checks under his shoe.*

- **HELEN:** It's horse shit.

sd: *WOODY checks his other shoe.*

- **HELEN:** In the bag outside.
- **SIOBHAN:** Helen brought supper.
- **WOODY:** Eh?**
- **HELEN:** For the garden. Bag each in the car. Might be an idea if I move it away from the door, though.

sd: *She gets up to move to the door.*

- **WOODY:** Hang on, Helen. I'll do it.**

sd: *SIOBHAN moves in between him and the door.*

# Page 88

- **SIOBHAN:** No hurry, Woody. We don't mind, really. Let's get started, eh?
- **LOUISE:** Well, the smell is drifting in a bit.

sd: *SIOBHAN looks at LOUISE and drags her finger across her throat as she tries to move WOODY away from the door.*

- **SIOBHAN:** We can move them when we take a break.
- **WOODY:** Won't take me a minute.**
- **LOUISE:** Actually, it's got a nice earthiness to it, hasn't it? Natural. I'm rather enjoying it now.
- **WOODY:** O-kay.**
- **SIOBHAN:** *(Easing WOODY away from the door)* Well, I must say you seem a bit jollier tonight.
- **WOODY:** It's been a good week. A bloody good week.**
- **LOUISE:** So, have you resolved things with Maggie then? Is she coming home?
- **WOODY:** Not resolved. Dissolved! When I thought about her trying to sell this house from under me, without a bloody word, when she knows full well what it means to me, it all became clear. This was my grandfather's place. He left it to my parents and I bought it from them when they retired to the beach. It's the old homestead.**
- **LOUISE:** But you still have to give Maggie half, don't you?
- **WOODY:** Yeah, well, I'm working on that. I'd rather cut off my arm than lose everything Grandad worked for. I've sent her a message saying that if she just gives me time I'll find the money to pay her out. If that's what she wants.**
- **LOUISE:** Did you get a reply?

sd: *WOODY shakes his head.*

# Page 89

- **WOODY:** Anyone know if Annabel is coming?**
- **SIOBHAN:** No idea.
- **WOODY:** The week just gets better and better. Onwards. Now, ladies, you may have heard the expression 'measure twice, cut once'. Best advice I can give you. So that's what we're going to be doing tonight. I doubt you'll be needing your hard hat for this, Siobhan.**
- **SIOBHAN:** *(She whacks him)* Oh, for feck's sake. Why didn't you tell me?
- **WOODY:** Accurate measurements saves a lot of heartache later. Now, all week some sneaky bastard's been putting those bloody signs up...** 

sd: *He goes and turns around one of the coffin cut-outs. We see private sale and phone numbers on the back.*

- **WOODY:** But they've come in handy, really. So, I've made a template.**
- **LOUISE:** Like a sewing pattern.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, I guess. I want you to measure the outline, then you'll be making your own blueprint to draw onto the timber when we get it. Helen, have you given that any thought?**
- **HELEN:** What are my options?
- **WOODY:** Plenty. I'lI show you, if you like. Come up to the house. I've got some beautiful pieces my grandfather made. A joiner by trade, but a craftsman at heart - a bloody talented one. Whole dining set, Welsh dresser, bookcases, chest of drawers. You name it, he could make it. Not like that mass-produced crap you get these days. *(He moves to the door)* Louise and Siobhan, tape measures. You can make a start.**

sd: *He gives tape measures to them.*

# Page 90

- **SIOBHAN:** *(Getting in his way)* Why can't we just trace around this template?
- **WOODY:** Because that would be cheating, and Helen hasn't chosen the wood yet.**
- **HELEN:** Would you mind if we looked a bit later? My hip's been playing up today.
- **LOUISE:** Are you alright? Can we get you anything?
- **HELEN:** *(Pointedly)* No, I'm fine. Just need to sit here a bit.
- **WOODY:** Nah, nah, she's right, we can have a gander when it's tea time.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Woody why are you being so ... nice?
- **WOODY:** Because I am bloody nice. Anyway, Helen did me a favour. The first of many, I'm hoping The least I can do is pay her back.**
- **LOUISE:** What did she do?
- **HELEN:** Aiding and abetting?
- **WOODY:** Damn straight. I took a punt on Shelly Bay to win and Dream Baby for a place. And the stars lined up for Woody.**
- **HELEN:** Well done.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, the races. I chickened out. Bought two scratchies instead
- **SIOBHAN:** That's just a mug's game.
- **HELEN:** Fortune favours the brave, Louise.
- **WOODY:** And it did. About time my luck turned. No more Mr Sad-arse-limp-dick. I'm going to fight Maggie every step of the way Thanks to Helen I can now afford a decent lawyer, so I've got a sporting chance.**
- **HELEN:** Oh, shit. How much?

# Page 91

- **WOODY:** How much what?**
- **HELEN:** How much did you bet?
- **WOODY:** *(Mumbling)* Just a bit ... not much. I can't remember.**
- **SIOBHAN:** How much?
- **WOODY:** Five grand. The last of my redundancy pay out.**

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Oh. My. God. You idiot.
- **WOODY:** But shit, it was worth it!**
- **HELEN:** That's it, Woody. No more
- **WOODY:** What? Why?**
- **HELEN:** I'm serious. I'm not a clairvoyant, you know. If rd known you were going to risk that much ... Hell, I do value what's left of my life you know? I- it would have been like walking onto a minefield.
- **SIOBHAN:** A massacre.

sd: *SIOBHAN moves up to look out the back window.*

- **HELEN:** It wasn't even a dry track How Shelly Bay finished at all is miracle
- **WOODY:** And that was just what I was needing Anyway, moving on. Louise, call out the measurements. Helen can write them.**
- **HELEN:** Cheers.

sd: *WOODY is fossicking for more bits of cardboard. LOUISE takes the tape measure, measures a side, calls out the number.*

- **LOUISE:** Across the middle: sixty six centimetres.

sd: *The tape automatically retracts giving LOUISE a hell of a fright.*

- **LOUISE:** Aggghhhh!

# Page 92

- **WOODY:** Here. *(He shows her how to lock off the tape)* And it's the outline you want. Not across here, that's no bloody use. Oi, Irish?**
- **SIOBHAN:** What?
- **WOODY:** What are you looking at?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Nothing Just the beautiful night.
- **LOUISE:** Toe end: thirty centimetres.

sd: *LOUISE lets the tape retract again.*

- **LOUISE:** Aggghhhh!
- **WOODY:** Jeez, Louise.**
- **HELEN:** *(Getting up)* Here, give that to me. You keep score.

sd: *She hands a pen and paper to LOUISE.*

- **WOODY:** Get yourself over here, Siobhan. I've done some doghouse plans you can start to work on.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Ta, but surplus to requirements now.
- **WOODY:** What do you mean?**
- **SIOBHAN:** I got fired. Story of my life.
- **LOUISE:** Oh, the clinic? What happened?
- **HELEN:** Lower long side: one hundred and forty two centimetres.
- **SIOBHAN:** The alarm wasn't on after all, so that was a fair cop to me. You see, I was thinking how Martin and me were going to be meeting back there later and I must have got it into my head that we'd put the alarm on then. You don't expect burglaries that early in the evening, do you? Anyway, they got away with everything. Though, God knows what they want with animal drugs. You could be taking something for worms and you'd be none the wiser.

# Page 93

- **HELEN:** It's ketamine they're after. Horse tranquilliser, a bit LSD.
- **WOODY:** Donkey dust. Bloody poison.**
- **HELEN:** You've tried it? Top short side: sixty-one centimetres.
- **WOODY:** Once. Stupid. The TV grew legs and arms, my heart was going 'seventy-six trombones', thought I was going to die. Never again.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Anyway, the long and the short of it is Martin made it very clear I couldn't be trusted. At the clinic or with his labradoodle.
- **LOUISE:** No more Martin?
- **SIOBHAN:** Nup.
- **LOUISE:** I'm really sorry.
- **HELEN:** That's tough about the job. What do you think vou'll do?
- **SIOBHAN:** What I always do when I'm between jobs - sell myself on the streets.

sd: *They all stare at her.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Busking! I'm a singer. Oh, God, for a minute there, Woody, you actually looked excited.
- **LOUISE:** To be honest, I think you're better off without the vet.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, wasn't he, like, really old?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah, but he made me feel... sort of, cared about, you know? So.

sd: *LOUISE comes and puts her arm around SIOBHAN.*

- **WOODY:** Oh, Christ. Come on, Cheer up, Irish. I'll... let you play with my power tools.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Now, there's an offer you can't refuse.

# Page 94

- **WOODY:** Okay, may as well show you all, but go easy with them Helen?**

sd: *HELEN comes over while WOODY gets out a power drill driver.*

- **WOODY:** Now, it's pretty simple, you lock and load the drill like this ... *(He demonstrates)* and just press the trigger.**

sd: *He gives the drill to SIOBHAN who drills a hole in a piece of wood.*

- **WOODY:** Good. Okay, Louise, you're going to screw this into the hole Siobhan's made. Hold here. Right. *(He hands her the power drill driver)* Don't look so nervous, it won't bite you. Press the trigger.**

sd: *LOUISE lightly squeezes the trigger. Nothing happens.*

- **WOODY:** Harder.**

sd: *LOUISE squeezes the trigger again.*

- **WOODY:** That's it. Okay, Siobhan, drill another hole and Helen can have a go.**

sd: *LOUISE accidentally pushes the trigger as she's handing the power drill driver to HELEN. HELEN has to take evasive action.*

- **HELEN:** Woah.
- **WOODY:** Take your finger off! Christ, Louise. Never aim a drill at anyone. You nearly took her eye out.**
- **LOUISE:** It just went off. I'm sorry.
- **WOODY:** Remind me never to let you near my nail gun.**

sd: *He takes out some wood and some screws.*

- **WOODY:** Right, now see what you can do with these. Drill and screw.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Like Shooters Bar on a Friday night. Except that's more a case of skull and screw.

sd: *SIOBHAN and HELEN start to work. WOODY goes to the door.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Where are you going?

# Page 95

- **WOODY:** Call of nature, not that it's any business of yours.**

sd: *LOUISE quickly gets between WOODY and the door.*

- **LOUISE:** Just go in here.

sd: *WOODY looks at her like she's mad.*

- **LOUISE:** In a jar.
- **WOODY:** Piss in a jar? You're mental.**

sd: *Suddenly ANNABEL enters at pace without knocking, banging the door into LOUISE who gets pushed into WOODY.*

- **ANNABEL:** What are you doing standing behind the door?
- **LOUISE:** *(Rubbing her head)* I was ... ouch.
- **SIOBHAN:** You right there, Louise?
- **ANNABEL:** *(Snaps at SIOBHAN)* Well, I'm sorry but how was I to know?

sd: *ANNABEL marches in, taking off her coat.*

- **ANNABEL:** And someone's left something with a truly unpleasant odour outside the door.
- **WOODY:** Maybe it's your manners.**
- **ANNABEL:** I said I was sorry! I wish you'd told me you were moving out, Woody. I would have got Lindsey to drop me off. I've told you I don't like to leave the car on the street in this part of town.
- **WOODY:** I'm not moving. What are you on about?**
- **ANNABEL:** Well, there's a very large truck blocking your driveway, seemingly being loaded up with furniture.
- **WOODY:** No, no!**

sd: *WOODY races out before anyone can stop him. SIOBHAN follows him to the door.*

# Page 96

- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, Christ. *(Calls)* Woody! Woody! Oh, shite.

sd: *HELEN and LOUISE are up looking out the back window.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Should we go after him?
- **HELEN:** I don't think that would be wise.
- **ANNABEL:** What exactly is going on?
- **SIOBHAN:** Maggie called me. Said she wanted us to keep Woody busy while she picked up her stuff. I thought she meant clothes and that. She said that she hadn't had time to pack before she left. I had no idea she meant to take like the whole feckin' household.
- **LOUISE:** Do you think there'll be a fight? Should we call the police?
- **ANNABEL:** She's entitled to get what belongs to her. He needs to grow up, he really does.
- **HELEN:** According to Woody the furniture has belonged in his family for generations, handmade by his grandfather. I don't think Maggie's playing by the rules here.
- **LOUISE:** To just take it without him even knowing. That's a terrible thing to do.
- **SIOBHAN:** And she's pissed off with our dosh, too. God, I feel like shite. I had no idea. And to make me the one who helped her. He's going to kill me.
- **HELEN:** You're not to blame. You just did what you were asked to do.
- **ANNABEL:** For once.
- **SIOBHAN:** What's that supposed to mean?

sd: *ANNABEL plonks herself down in WOODY's chair.*

- **ANNABEL:** Oh, this is all such a waste of time. Does it look like he's coming back?

# Page 97

- **LOUISE:** You can't really see in the dark.
- **SIOBHAN:** Christ, I hope there's not a scrap. How many men were there?
- **ANNABEL:** I saw two lifting a cabinet into the truck. Could have been more of them inside, I suppose.
- **LOUISE:** Do you think they're her brothers, the gang members?
- **SIOBHAN:** Shall we call the cops or what?
- **HELEN:** Nothing's really happened yet.
- **ANNABEL:** At least Maggie has protection. That's good to know.
- **SIOBHAN:** Did you see her up there?
- **ANNABEL:** No.
- **LOUISE:** It's the sentimental value of things, isn't it?
- **ANNABEL:** Sentiment doesn't come under the Matrimonial Property Act.
- **LOUISE:** But, it's not about what you could sell it for. It's priceless when it's been handed down through the family. Alison, Mother's lifeline, has been coming in and taking the odd thing to sell on Mother's behalf. Things I would have loved to have kept. Like a miniature Toby Jug, that for as long as I can remember always used to sit on my grandmother's shadow box in the front room. Just gone.
- **HELEN:** Oh, Louise. You have to put a stop to this Alison woman. It's mad. She can't come into your home taking things to sell, things that belong to you.
- **LOUISE:** Belong to Mother.
- **SIOBHAN:** Tell her to feck off. I would.
- **ANNABEL:** For God's sake, if you don't stick up for yourself for once in your life then you've only got yourself to blame.

# Page 98

- **LOUISE:** *(Slightly taken aback by ANNABEL's tone)* Well it's. complicated.
- **ANNABEL:** No, I mean it. You can choose to be a victim all your life or you can sort out your issues and learn to become a fully functioning adult woman rather than some helpless little girl lost.

*Beat.*
sd: *They all stare at ANNABEL*

- **ANNABEL:** What? I'm only stating the obvious.

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** I know how you must have felt about the Toby Jug, You see, when my mammy died, my dad moved the widow woman from next door in, three months to the day of her death. Anyway, in she comes and she's all like 'new broom, sweep clean' attitude and she tells my dad she can't be sleeping in my mammy's old bed and orders a whole new bedroom suite. That bed was the bed I was born in. And the dressing table, well, I used to think it was magic, you know. It had these swing mirrors so you could see all sides and a little velvet stool. I'd been watching Mammy putting her hair up and her face on since I was old enough to stand.
- **LOUISE:** What happened to it all?
- **SIOBHAN:** I tried to make my dad keep it or store it for me for when I was older. I was fifteen at the time. Tried everything to persuade him - I'd give up all my pocket money, I'd do extra work around the house - but the widow woman had put the hard word on him to sell, so he did. To the Second Time Around shop down the road. I'd be walking to school and there would be my mammy's bed in the window of the shop with an ugly little stuffed toy that looked like a ferret lying in the middle and the dressing table set up with its green padded stool - I could see my own reflection staring back from the mirrors. And there was her hairbrush set…

# Page 99

sd: *The women are silent. SIOBHAN starts to cry.*

- **LOUISE:** That must have been so hard for you. To lose your mother so young,
- **SIOBHAN:** It was. It felt like the end of the world, you know. It still does.

*Beat.*
sd: *ANNABEL's had enough.*

- **ANNABEL:** It's not the end of the world though, is it? You're still here, large as life, leaving a trail of chaos wherever you go.
- **SIOBHAN:** What do you mean by that?
- **ANNABEL:** Real life to you is something to squeeze in between pints, isn't it? Affairs with married men, jobs you can't keep, alarms you casually forget to turn on.
- **HELEN:** Annabel.
- **SIOBHAN:** Who told you the alarm wasn't on?
- **ANNABEL:** *(On a roll now)* Your ex-boss's wife happens to play bridge. Yes, we heard all about the airhead who forgot to turn the alarm on all for the sake of a bit of tawdry sex on a pile of dog biscuits.
- **SIOBHAN:** I bet he didn't tell her that bit.
- **ANNABEL:** And do you know or even care what the consequences of your actions are?
- **SIOBHAN:** They busted down the door! They would have got to the drugs anyway.
- **ANNABEL:** But you gave them precious time! Thanks to you I've had to spend the week in and out of hospital with a client who overdosed and nearly died. Thanks to your carelessness.

sd: *SIOBHAN is too shocked to answer. HELEN rounds on ANNABEL.*

# Page 100

- **HELEN:** Annabel, what is the matter with you? Ever since you arrived you've been on the attack. What about me? Care to have a go? Must be my turn for you to shine your little torch on all my human frailties.

sd: *ANNABEL puts her coat back on and gathers her bag.*

- **ANNABEL:** I don't see the point really, Helen.
- **HELEN:** No? You do surprise me, because I have a shitload of failings. Quite a lot of them very obvious, actually. I thought an expert on pop psychology like you-
- **ANNABEL:** Pop psychology? I studied for six years to get my MA in counselling. I sit day in, day out listening to the most delusional, miserable stories with seldom any thanks. I'm just the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. I've tried to help you come to terms with what you're facing, but you continually deny there's any need. So answer me this then Helen - truthfully, if you can - what is the real reason for you being here?

sd: *Silence.*

- **ANNABEL:** Well, I'll answer it for you. You're here because you're terrified there isn't a single person who cares enough about you, not even your own children, to prevent you from dying totally alone.

*Beat.*

- **HELEN:** See now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

sd: *WOODY* comes crashing in with a bloody handkerchief to his nose. His shirt is ripped.

- **WOODY:** Out! All of you, out!**
- **LOUISE:** Oh, Woody.
- **WOODY:** We're so done here.**
- **ANNABEL:** Gladly.
sd: ANNABEL royally passes SIOBHAN.

# Page 101

- **SIOBHAN:** By the way, Annabel. This 'client of yours in the hospital, he's not called Angus by any chance, is he? Only, that was one of the names the cops mentioned in relation to the burglary.

sd: *ANNABEL looks at her then leaves.* *The others get their things too. WOODY walks across the room then turns, looking at them.*

- **WOODY:** I hope you're all satisfied. Thirty pieces of silver you've got between you now, is it? Sleep well, Judas-s. *(Realising he needs to make it plural)***

*The women exit, shutting the door behind them. WOODY collapses into his chair. He is still for a bit, then slowly he covers his face in his hands and begins to cry.
Lights down. Music.*

sd: *Later the same night. WOODY is in his chair, feet propped up with a duvet over him. He's sleeping. We hear tapping on the door and muffled voices shushing.*

- **SIOBHAN:** (Off) Woody? Woody?

sd: *Louder tapping on the door.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Woody?
- **WOODY:** *(Waking up)* Bloody hell.**

sd: *He gets himself up and over to the door.*

- **WOODY:** Who is it?**
- **SIOBHAN:** It's me, Siobhan. Would you open the door?
- **WOODY:** It's the middle of the night.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Please, Woody.

# Page 102

sd: *He unlocks the door. SIOBHAN is holding a very drunk LOUISE. They stumble into the room. An outside light illuminates them from the open door.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Thank God you're here. Would you give us a hand?

sd: *WOODY gets on the other side of LOUISE and holds her up.*

- **LOUISE:** Look, it's Woody.
- **WOODY:** Let's put her in the chair.**

sd: *They move LOUISE to the chair. WOODY switches on the table lamp.*

- **LOUISE:** She was only the woodman's daughter but you should have seen her ring bark!
- **WOODY:** What the hell's going on?**
- **SIOBHAN:** I'm so sorry. Truly I am. But I had no choice.
- **LOUISE:** We've went to the Murphy's Law.
- **SIOBHAN:** For a drink, after you kicked us out. She got completely hammered.
- **LOUISE:** Completely - pink - hammered! *(She finds this very funny)*
- **SIOBHAN:** And she can't find her house keys.
- **LOUISE:** I can't find my keys.
- **SIOBHAN:** And she thinks she might have left them here.
- **LOUISE:** Left them here.
- **WOODY:** Why didn't you take her home to your place?**
- **SIOBHAN:** I tried, honest to God, but-
- **LOUISE:** No! No! I have to go home. I have to guard the house.
- **SIOBHAN:** You see? I think she's getting confused with what happened here. She thinks a truck is going to come and take all her things.

# Page 103

- **LOUISE:** That bitch, Alison! Anything I can get you, jean.' Ive bought some cake for you, Jean.' Drive you to the doctat, post your letter, whatever you need, Jean'
- **WOODY:** Whos Jean?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Her mother, I think.
- **LOUISE:** Pat a pillow behind your neck, Jean.' Louise, cant you see your mother needs propping up? Gardens looking a sight, Jean. Whats Louise doing about that? She has all the time in the world. No job, hmm, Louise? '1 bought a few things for Jean - hand cream. No, no, she gave me her money card! Louise, your mother told me, you know. Your mother told me what you did
- **SIOBHAN:** Louise, you didn't do anything
- **LOUISE:** But, I did. Where's Wally?
- **WOODY:** Woody I'm right here.**
- **LOUISE:** I killed him
- **WOODY:** What?**
- **SIOBHAN:** She wont stop going on about this
- **LOUISE:** Stone dead. Dead as a dead.
- **SIOBHAN:** You didn't, Louise. It wasn't your fault.
- **WOODY:** What's she on about?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Her father.
- **LOUISE:** Choking, choking him
- **WOODY:** Jesus!**
- **SIOBHAN:** Her father choked on and dementia and God knows rething He had Parkinson's. She was telling me it all on the way over.

# Page 104

- **LOUISE:** And Mother standing in the doorway watching me. Saw it all. Pointing 'What sort of nurse are you Louise?

sd: *LOUISE mimes the Heimlich manoeuvre, making vomity sounds.*

- **LOUISE:** Heimlich. Heimlich.
- **WOODY:** She's not going to spew, is she?**
- **SIOBHAN:** No, she's saying she tried the Heimlich manoeuvre, you know, to make him spit it up.
- **LOUISE:** 'What sort of nurse are you? Pointing the finger. But I had never done it before and I just kept squeezing and squeezing, and I squeezed him- him to death.
- **SIOBHAN:** Louise, it's okay. You did your best. Your mum was wrong to lay all that on you. Let it be now, okay?

sd: *SIOBHAN rubs LOUISE's back and comforts her. LOUISE looks like she's falling asleep. SIOBHAN looks to **WOODY.***

- **SIOBHAN:** Right, better look for her keys, I suppose.
- **WOODY:** I'll turn the light on.**
- **SIOBHAN:** I'm truly sorry about all this, honest. What a shithouse day.

sd: *WOODY goes over to the door and turns the main light on. LOUISE reacts to the brightness.*

- **LOUISE:** Noooo, I have to get home. She'll get in.
- **SIOBHAN:** Shh, darling I'll get you home, Louise. Just as soon as we find your feckin' keys.

sd: *WOODY and SIOBHAN start looking.*

- **LOUISE:** Bisshorn?
- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah?
- **LOUISE:** Bisshorn?

# Page 105

- **SIOBHAN:** Yes, I'm right here, Louise.
- **LOUISE:** I'm not a virgin you know, Bisshorn.
- **WOODY:** Oh, Christ.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Goodo.
- **LOUISE:** People think unmarried, ooh, spinster, poor old withered trout, but no-
- **SIOBHAN:** That's fine, Louise. I believe you.
- **LOUISE:** -with a Cuban, but they sent him home. He had a big cigar.
- **WOODY:** They're not here, could they have fallen out on the drive?**
- **LOUISE:** Woody's here. Hello, Woody, is that really your real-real name, really?
- **WOODY:** No, it's Guthrie.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Hey, that's cool. I like that.
- **LOUISE:** Like Guthrie Bowon.
- **WOODY:** No, like Woody Guthrie, the folk singer.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Let me check her pockets again.

sd: *SIOBHAN goes over and feels in LOUISE's pocket.**

- **LOUISE:** Six months to a year and then that's it.
- **SIOBHAN:** What's it?
- **LOUISE:** Lights out.
- **SIOBHAN:** You mean your mother?
- **LOUISE:** Not s'mother, Helen.
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh.
- **LOUISE:** That's sad, isn't it? Helen of Troy and the horses.

# Page 106

- **SIOBHAN:** It is that. It's really sad.
- **LOUISE:** Who will look after the horses?
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, I expect someone will.
- **LOUISE:** Could Wally?
- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah, maybe Wally could.
- **LOUISE:** I just need to sleep- just sleep now.

sd: *SIOBHAN looks to WOODY. He shrugs - it's okay. WOODY turns the main light off so there is just the lamp light. SIOBHAN tucks the duvet around LOUISE, takes off her shoes.*

- **SIOBHAN:** There you go. You sleep it off now. Sweet dreams.
- **LOUISE:** It's all a big mess isn't it? (She starts to cry)
- **SIOBHAN:** Shh, shh.

sd: *SIOBHAN sits on the arm of the chair. She strokes LOUISE's hair and starts to quietly sing the Kate Bush rendition of 'My Lagan Love' LOUISE falls asleep. WOODY listens*

- **WOODY:** You've got a really good voice.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Ah, you should have heard my mother. Now she could sing.

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Woody, Maggie didn't tell me the whole truth, you know. I would never have gone along with that. None of us would've.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, but in the end you chose to trust her over me. So... shows what you think of me. Can't say as I blame you, really. She's pretty convincing when she wants to be.**
- **SIOBHAN:** She's mean is what she is. We all feel like shite. And we're all so sorry.

sd: *WOODY just shrugs.*

# Page 107

- **WOODY:** So are you-are you going to head off?**
- **SIOBHAN:** I think I should hang around to keep an eye on her. If nou don't mind. I just feel a bit responsible, you know? I didn't realise that every time she was going up to the bar she was baving a couple of shots before she came back with her wine. And I knew she wasnt a drinker.
- **WOODY:** That's not your fault.**
- **SIOBHAN:** It was me who suggested the pub. A fuck up all round, really How's your nose, by the way?
- **WOODY:** Sore. But I'll live.**
- **SIOBHAN:** What happened?
- **WOODY:** I was trying to reason with Maggie-**
- **SIOBHAN:** So, she was there?
- **WOODY:** It's her truck.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Cripes - hardcore.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, well, she works in construction same as me and if you're a woman you have to be pretty hardcore to hang in there.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Ill say.
- **WOODY:** You know, I was proud of her for that. I'd never met anyone, well a woman anyway, who loved wood like me, loved what it can do, the feel of it, smell of it. Why I fell for her, I guess. She's really talented too, learned everything I taught her and then went after a job in the industry. Nailed that too. No one made it easy for her, but she never complained about the conditions or that Staunch, that's Mags. But you don't want to stand in her way, that's for sure.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Why? What happens?
- **WOODY:** *(indicates his nose)* This.**

# Page 108

- **SIOBHAN:** She bopped you one? Oh, my God. What did you do?
- **WOODY:** Well, contrary to what all you think of me - I walked away. Like I always do. Oh, occasionally I might throw something, but I never aim to strike. But tonight I thought - I can't be arsed with all this any more - let the better man win.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Man?
- **WOODY:** I keep forgetting, you've never met Maggie, have you?**

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** So, what went wrong between you two?
- **WOODY:** I don't know. It's not the first time she's played away. But she's always come back. Should've done something about it, I guess. I just couldn't work out what would make her happy. She was always on at me to sell the house, build our own, go to Oz, make more money.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Sounds like some of those things might have made her happy.
- **WOODY:** This is where I belong. This is my home. I'm not moving.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Living a life like your grandad?
- **WOODY:** Nothing wrong with that. I'm happy with that. Got everything I need right here.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Except your wife.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, well there's that. What about you?**
- **SIOBHAN:** What about me?
- **WOODY:** There must be some reason you've travelled across the world only to end up in Palmy. Some bloke you're trying to get away from?**

# Page 109

- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah, well, that bloke would be my dad. After Mammy died, I was at the grave almost every day - went a wee bit mad. I wanted to un-dig it with my bare hands. Tried to one day and Dad threatened to have me sectioned if I didn't quit it. Then he got Mrs Next Door in. So, as soon as I was eighteen, I just left the lot of them. Slipped off the edge of Ireland and launched myself into the great unknown.
- **WOODY:** Did you know what you were going to do?**
- **SIOBHAN:** No, and that was the beauty of it. Worked in Glasgow for a bit, then London for a few years. Bummed around Europe, then my cousin came out here and said why didn't I come over. So I did. Just for a holiday to start, and I sort of got stuck. Probably time for me to move on.
- **WOODY:** But why do you want to keep moving? You're, like, really pretty ...**
- **SIOBHAN:** Aw, sweet.
- **WOODY:** Be easy for you to find a bloke. You know, one who's not married.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Maybe. I just don't like to be tied down. Maybe I just like it if it's for fun. Maybe deep down I'm happy being shallow.
- **WOODY:** I don't think you're shallow.**

*Beat.*

- **WOODY:** Do you hear from your family much?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, sure. Dad's always on the email, says he misses me. My brothers have kids now that I've never met, but they send photos.
- **WOODY:** Then why not go back - just for a visit, even?**
- **SIOBHAN:** And find Mammy gone all over again? No, this way feels safer, this way I can still pretend.

# Page 110

- **WOODY:** But, maybe she'd want you to see the grandchildren she never got to see, you know? Keep an eye out for them. For her?**

*Beat.*

- **SIOBHAN:** I'd never thought of it like that. You ever travelled overseas?
- **WOODY:** Yeah. Blenheim.**
- **SIOBHAN:** What? Not even Australia?
- **WOODY:** No, it's just more of the same, isn't it?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, Woody it's not. It's incredible. Doesn't matter where it is. I remember walking out from my hotel in Rome and looking down the street and there's the Colosseum just down the end of the road, something built by the Romans like thousands of years old, and I could just walk up to it and touch it. Or the first time you find yourself on Park Lane, off the monopoly board, or you're on a Greek island and you've never seen the sea so blue and an old woman's just made you the oiliest fish dish ever and is watching you eat it waiting for you to smile. The world will trip you up and surprise you in ways you never even dreamed of. Like me coming to New Zealand and finding myself here in your workshop in the middle of the night, with a woman who thinks she killed her father.
- **WOODY:** It's not exactly Paris by moonlight, is it?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Well, no, but it's something new, something I couldn't have predicted. It's amazing what a bit of distance can do.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, well, I've never had the money.**
- **SIOBHAN:** That's bullshit.

sd: *She goes to her bag, gets 20 dollar bill out and pins it to the dartboard with a dart.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Here, this will get you started. Trust me, Woody, go and see the world - it has the best distractions ever.

# Page 111

- **WOODY:** Yeah. *(Looks at his watch)* Look it's nearly one-thirty. There's still a mattress in the house, if you want to sleep. Louise is out for the count, so you may as well.**
- **SIOBHAN:** What about you? Where will you go?
- **WOODY:** I've got an old camp stretcher somewhere I can put up. Don't worry, you'll be perfectly safe.**

sd: *SIOBHAN goes over to him.*

- **SIOBHAN:** And what if I don't want to be perfectly safe, hmm? What then?

sd: *WOODY looks taken aback.*

- **WOODY:** I-I-**
- **SIOBHAN:** (Laughs) I'm only teasing you. Oh, the look on your face - priceless. (She gives him a kiss) Come on, you can make me a cup of Milo.

sd: *She exits, leaving WOODY looking like he's just found a penny but lost a pound. He slowly goes over and turns the lamp off and exits, leaving a snoring LOUISE.*

**Scene 3**

sd: *A new day. Light coming through the window. LOUISE is still sleeping in the chair. There's a firm knock on the door. LOUISE wakes with a yelp. She doesn't know where she is - her head is aching. Another knock. Wrapped in the duvet, she carefully makes her way over to open the door.*

- **LOUISE:** Annabel?
- **ANNABEL:** What on earth are you doing here?

sd: *ANNABEL enters. LOUISE makes her way back to the chair.*

# Page 112

- **LOUISE:** I don't know. I honestly.. don't know what I'm doing here. But my head is really sore.
- **ANNABEL:** Has there been an accident?
- **LOUISE:** I don't know.

sd: *She puts her head in her hands.*

- **ANNABEL:** Do you know where Woody is? I tried the house but there didn't seem to be anyone there.
- **LOUISE:** (Groans) I need a glass of water.
- **ANNABEL:** There might be something in the fridge.

sd: *LOUISE groans but can't move.*

- **ANNABEL:** Shall I have a look?

sd: *LOUISE nods. ANNABEL goes over and opens the fridge.*

- **ANNABEL:** Only beer, by the looks.

sd: *LOUISE groans.*

- **ANNABEL:** No, wait. There's a Coke at the back, will that do?
- **LOUISE:** (Feebly) Yes.
- **ANNABEL:** (Looking around) No glass, I'm afraid.

sd: *Door opens. In storms WOODY, who sees ANNABEL opening the can of Coke.*

- **WOODY:** What's going on?**
- **LOUISE:** (Cries in pain) Not so loud.
- **ANNABEL:** Louise wanted a glass of water. She's not well and this was all I could find.
- **WOODY:** Did you just knock on the front door?**
- **ANNABEL:** Yes.

# Page 113

- **LOUISE:** Please can you give me the drink.

sd: *ANNABEL takes the Coke to LOUISE.*

- **ANNABEL:** No one answered, so I thought I'd try down here.

sd: *SIOBHAN enters, looking a bit dishevelled in a man's T-shirt and shorts and bare feet.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Annabel? It's like Groundhog Day around here, isn't it? (She sees LOUISE) Oh, look at you, you poor wee thing.

sd: *SIOBHAN goes over to LOUISE and perches on the arm of the chair.*

- **ANNABEL:** I came to -I was wanting a word with Woody, actually. But I wasn't expecting everyone else to be here.
- **SIOBHAN:** Some of us just can't get enough of a good thing Eh, Louise?

sd: *LOUISE groans.*

- **ANNABEL:** Is she hung-over?
- **SIOBHAN:** Just a bit.

sd: *SIOBHAN rubs LOUISE's back.*

- **ANNABEL:** I suppose you're responsible for that?

sd: *SIOBHAN takes a deep breath in and ignores that comment.*

- **LOUISE:** I want to die.
- **SIOBHAN:** (Laughs) I knew it would hurt.
- **LOUISE:** How did I get here? I remember the bar ... vaguely
- **WOODY:** Ah, but do you remember the Cuban?**
- **LOUISE:** (Mortified) What? Oh, dear God noooo...
- **SIOBHAN:** You'd lost your keys, right, and you were sure you left them here.

# Page 114

- **LOUISE:** Did I find them?
- **WOODY:** No. You couldn't even find your own feet.**
- **LOUISE:** (Groans) So, then what happened?
- **SIOBHAN:** You sort of collapsed, so we thought it best to let you sleep.
- **LOUISE:** Did you go home?
- **SIOBHAN:** No, I was with Woody in the house.

sd: *LOUISE looks at SIOBHAN and WOODY.*

- **WOODY:** And no, it's not what you're thinking.**
- **LOUISE:** Oh, that's a shame.
- **SIOBHAN:** (Laughs) Woody was the perfect gentleman.
- **ANNABEL:** I'm sorry if I've interrupted anything...
- **SIOBHAN:** Not at all. If you're wanting a word with Woody in private, maybe it's best outside. I'm not sure we can move Louise just yet.
- **ANNABEL:** No, I, well... actually I came round to see if Woody knew where I could get hold of you.
- **SIOBHAN:** Ah, right. Woody, be a love and pop inside and put a pot of tea on, would you? And bring a big glass of water and a Panadol back for Louise.
- **WOODY:** The teapot's gone so it will have to be teabags.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Perfect.

sd: *WOODY exits, muttering about being a bloody slave in his own house.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Okay before you start, I just want to say I am so, so sorry about the alarm, the burglary and everything. Totally my fault. I was such an idiot. It's unforgivable and I'm truly sorry.
- **ANNABEL:** No, no, you don't understand-

# Page 115

- **SIOBHAN:** (Interrupting her) It's your son that's in the hospital, right?

sd: *ANNABEL nods.*

- **SIOBHAN:** I owe him an apology too.
- **ANNABEL:** Why? He's an addict. Nothing you've done changes that.
- **SIOBHAN:** But I'm sure he didn't mean to overdose. It was the stuff they found that did it.
- **ANNABEL:** I'm not so sure. Anyway, I wanted to apologise to you for the way I spoke and-
- **SIOBHAN:** Annabel, your son could have died. You're his mum. If that had been me in that position, I tell you what, I would have been blaming everyone in sight. I would've been lashing out in all directions. You could have lost your child. How terrifying is that for a mother?
- **ANNABEL:** (Moved by SIOBHAN's kindness) I... I said some pretty hurtful things. It would be understandable if you were angry...
- **SIOBHAN:** I am angry but not with you. I'm angry at myself for forgetting the feckin' alarm.
- **LOUISE:** It wouldn't have made any difference.
- **ANNABEL:** Louise is right. It wouldn't have changed a thing and I had no right to take it out on all of you. I feel like such a fraud, you know. Here's me, the trained counsellor, with all the resources at my disposal and I can't even ... even see what was happening to my own-(*ANNABEL is trying to rein it in*) But you don't really want to hear all that.
- **SIOBHAN:** We're not going anywhere. Are we, Louise?

sd: *LOUISE shakes her head. It hurts to do so.*

# Page 116

- **ANNABEL:** It's just-to be honest the last two years have been a living hell. Everywhere I go I know what people are thinking, Oh, look at her, the counsellor whose own son turns out to be a drug addict. Hope she's not counselling anyone I know? I'm sure they talk about me at bridge, at tennis. The counselling community shy away from referring people to me with drug and alcohol problems now. Even The Dickens Book Club prefer to have meetings at someone else's place rather than mine. I started to feel so isolated. That's why I thought I'd try the Pink Hammer, you know, to meet some new people who wouldn't know my situation. Lindsey says 'Let's just move to Wellington, get away from it all, leave Angus in the mess he's created, and the truth is I would love to move, really I would. Because you see, he's making me look bad. He's embarrassing me and I can't stand it. My image means more to me than the pain my son is in. What sort of a mother does that make me?
- **SIOBHAN:** But you haven't left, have you? You're still here.
- **ANNABEL:** He refuses to see me, even his therapist has told me to leave well alone. He'll be staying with his father when he's out of hospital. Im not sure what he's going to be charged with either, for the break-in. No doubt that will be in the papers.
- **SIOBHAN:** Yeah, that's tough.
- **ANNABEL:** Our family was what all families should aspire to. That's what I thought. We travelled, we took Angus around art galleries in Europe, America. And I had no idea he was struggling with his seruality. I suspected he might have been gay - I was even secretly delighted. It made us seem somehow ... I don't know ... modern, liberal. I thought 'Wonderful, we can go shopping together. Oh, God.
- **SIOBHAN:** Well, it's great you were supporting him.
- **ANNABEL:** Was I? I didn't even notice hed stopped drawing, stopped sleeping I had no idea he was taking drugs, never entered my mind. The first time he was hospitalised I felt so

# Page 117

- **ANNABEL:** betrayed and totally humiliated - I told him to clean up his act or else. He was seventeen. I'd never say that to a client.
- **SIOBHAN:** What was the 'or else?
- **ANNABEL:** I'm not sure what I meant but he left home anyway, and then everything just spiralled out of control, the people he lived with took drugs, he felt abandoned by me, he didn't have a relationship with his father. He doesn't know who he is. He's so angry it's terrifying.
- **SIOBHAN:** That's a very scary place to be in. For all of you.
- **ANNABEL:** Yes. It's hell and there's little I can do except to be here and to give him time and hope he can believe... how much I love him.

*Beat.*

- **ANNABEL:** Well, that's me. That's the complete shambles which is my life.
- **SIOBHAN:** Join the club.
- **ANNABEL:** Thank you... for listening.
- **SIOBHAN:** No problem. Any time.
- **ANNABEL:** Talking of clubs, what do you think the chances are that Woody would consider keeping the Pink Hammer going? If anyone else was interested? I know I could certainly use the distraction and the.
- **LOUISE:** Company?
- **ANNABEL:** Yes.
- **LOUISE:** Me too.
- **SIOBHAN:** I don't know. He's in a pretty dark place right now. So much is changing for him.
- **LOUISE:** He'd listen to you, though. And there's Helen's situation to consider as well.

# Page 118

sd: *SIOBHAN thinks about it.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Okay, I'll ask. I'm all for solidarity and a good cause and that...

sd: *She goes over to the door.*

- **SIOBHAN:** But I draw the line at having to sleep with the bugger.

sd: *She opens the door and turns back. WOODY arrives with the tea, stands unseen in the doorway by SIOBHAN.*

- **SIOBHAN:** He may be alright-looking, but in my experience, cavemen always turn out to have such disappointing clubs.

sd: *She turns to see WOODY standing there.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, shite!

sd: *Lights down. Music.*

**Scene Four**

sd: *Lights up. HELEN is watching the TV, nicely dressed in a black suit and a feathery hat. We hear pre-Melbourne Cup racing chat. Outside we hear laughter and chat and the sound of power tools.
WOODY enters.*

- **WOODY:** Christ all-bloody-mighty, they're exhausting. I know all about the menopause and the perimenopause and the post menopause, the personal summers, weight gain, hair loss, dry watutsi's. It's more detail than any man should ever have to know.**
- **HELEN:** Makes you wonder how Helen Clark managed to rule the country, doesn't it?
- **WOODY:** Or explains it! How we doing for time?**
- **HELEN:** Plenty of time before the gun.

sd: *HELEN puts the TV on mute.*

# Page 119

- **WOODY:** Right, well, they've just got the handles to do. Oh, while I remember.**

sd: *He gets a small bag of weed from somewhere hidden and passes it to HELEN.*

- **WOODY:** Here.**
- **HELEN:** Thanks. You really should let me pay you.

sd: *She gets up to go to her bag - she has a walking stick.*

- **WOODY:** I've told you I'm not a bloody drug dealer. It's the last of it anyway. Couldn't leave it here with the house being sold, could I?**
- **HELEN:** No, I suppose not. Big changes, Woody?
- **WOODY:** I've come to see it's just a house, it's not my grandfather. Nothing takes the memory of him away. Mags has given back some of the pieces he'd made, with a little help from my lawyer. But I don't need a four-bedroom place. I'll get something smaller, but with a bloody massive workshop.**
- **HELEN:** Any idea where?
- **WOODY:** Nah, not yet.**

sd: *SIOBHAN enters. She's wearing overalls and a fascinator on her head. She's holding another hat out to WOODY.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Woody!
- **WOODY:** What?**
- **SIOBHAN:** I made this specially for you. Now, will you please put it on!
- **WOODY:** I'lI look like a dick.**
- **SIOBHAN:** You are a dick. Come on, everyone's wearing one. For once in your life can you just join in the spirit of the thing It's the Melbourne Cup! (She plonks the hat on his head) You look so cute. Doesn't he, Helen?

# Page 120

- **HELEN:** Suits you, Woody. Brings out the colour of your eyes.

sd: *WOODY groans.*

- **SIOBHAN:** How we doing for time?
- **HELEN:** We're fine.
- **SIOBHAN:** Right, well, we're all going up to the house to get a bit spruced up. Louise has got a gorgeous new frock, she's like a new woman since she's been living with you.
- **HELEN:** I took her into town. She's had the Trump makeover.
- **SIOBHAN:** Ah ha! Thought as much.
- **WOODY:** She's had the what?**
- **HELEN:** Trumps. It's a dress shop.
- **SIOBHAN:** Helen, that's like saying the Vatican is just a church. Women come from miles around to get Trumped. And she looks brilliant. A good trumping was all she needed. Right, better get on. It's looking great, Helen. Louise has just finished the handles and Annabel is -
- **WOODY:** I told you to do the handles. Louise is bloody hopeless.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oi, don't you be saying that. She's done really well considering her fear of power tools. She should get Most Improved Player. She's dead proud of herself. There is going to be a prize-giving, isn't there?
- **WOODY:** For what?**
- **SIOBHAN:** Oh Christ, you're hopeless. Because today is our graduation! Six weeks of toil and dedication.
- **WOODY:** Should be me who gets a prize, for bloody endurance.**
- **HELEN:** Oh, cheer up, Woody.
- **SIOBHAN:** Yes, cheer up, you miserable sod. We're having a party whether you like it or not. Are you going to get changed?

# Page 121

- **WOODY:** No.**
- **SIOBHAN:** Bloody Kiwi blokes!

sd: *SIOBHAN exits. WOODY takes off his hat.*

- **HELEN:** Play nice. She's gone to a lot of trouble making these.
- **WOODY:** Yeah, well, she's all about the fun, isn't she? She only wants me to wear it so she can laugh at me. She's right about Louise, though. She does look different. Sort of ... I don't know, you just notice her more.**
- **HELEN:** And she's single. (She gives him a wink)
- **WOODY:** Piss off.**

sd: *HELEN laughs.*

- **WOODY:** How is it having her at your place?**
- **HELEN:** Good for me. I don't know what she gets out of it, though. I'm not much company.
- **WOODY:** She gets a roof over her head, and she enjoys nursing.**
- **HELEN:** And chauffeuring She's taken a liking to my Range Rover. She even backed the trailer down your drive this afternoon.
- **WOODY:** Shit, even I can't do that.**
- **HELEN:** She's extremely capable.
- **WOODY:** What about you though? Having someone round all the time, must be a bit of a change.**
- **HELEN:** Yeah, not easy making that adjustment. But it's good, you know, knowing someone's there. I was looking at some old photos the other day of when the boys were small. I was thinking how little I knew about being a parent. I thought, I'll just do what I've seen the mares in the field do. Give birth, feed, clean, do all the basic things to keep them alive. And that's what I did.

# Page 122

- **WOODY:** They've turned out alright, haven't they?**
- **HELEN:** I assume so. Truth is I don't really know. I was never a hands-on sort of mother. I couldn't wait to get the house back to myself again. I sent them to boarding school and left them to it. I just wasn't great at the touchy-feely stuff, you know? Just isn't me.
- **WOODY:** Yeah well, everyone's different. Personally, I could do without all that. My mum's like a limpet - you have to peel her off to get out the door.**
- **HELEN:** The photos got me thinking ... Oh, I don't know, that I should check that they'll be okay, you know ... Of course, I know they will be. But just to check in case ... I don't know. Tell them I'm sorry I wasn't more motherly, that sort of thing Square things away. But it's not easy to start a conversation like that. Not after so many years.
- **WOODY:** If you don't mind me saying so, Helen - you don't have a whole heap of time though, do you?**
- **HELEN:** Not a whole heap,
- **WOODY:** But they know you're sick, right? You've told them that.**
- **HELEN:** No, I haven't. I don't want them to feel they have any sort of responsibility to care for me.
- **WOODY:** But they're your kids. Shit, you've got to tell them.**
- **HELEN:** I've sat at the computer so many times trying to construct an email that informs them but has no sense of obligation and then I imagine myself waiting for their reply, wondering if there'd be one.
- **WOODY:** Of course there would be.**
- **HELEN:** Maybe, just not the reply I'd be hoping for.

*Beat.*

# Page 123

- **WOODY:** That would be pretty heartless.**
- **HELEN:** No, I don't think so. Oh, I'm sure they'd register what I was telling them but you reap what you sow, isn't that what they say? And I never gave them a lot to go on. They don't come back much - maybe every couple of years, and it's like having a house guest. That's not how it should feel, is it?
- **WOODY:** Look, I don't have kids, right? But I bet all parents think they could have done better. That's the reality, isn't it? There's no such thing as a perfect parent. You could have done a lot worse, and maybe it could have been better. But you have to tell them. Shit, if that was me and my mum, I'd feel gutted. I'd feel like she didn't give a damn about me.**
- **HELEN:** I'm sure that's what they already think.
- **WOODY:** You have to let them decide. And even if the answer is not what you want to hear, you'll feel better knowing that you tried. It's never too late.**

*Beat.*

- **HELEN:** Thanks.
- **WOODY:** Right. So, do you need a . .. hug, or something?**
- **HELEN:** (Laughs) Lucky for you, Woody, I'm not the hugging kind.

sd: *SIOBHAN enters followed by ANNABEL, both wearing black cocktail dresses and fascinators. They parade like a fashion show.*

- **SIOBHAN:** (Doing a twirl) Ta-da!
- **ANNABEL:** And last but not least, the pride of the Manawatü, Miss Louise Isobel Barnes!

sd: *LOUISE enters. She is totally transformed. There is cheering and whooping.*

- **SIOBHAN:** And for our next trick.

sd: *The women exit. We hear chatter. WOODY gets the saw horses organised. HELEN gets up with her stick and comes to have a look. The women enter with the coffin and rest it on the saw horses.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Just like a bought one.
- **LOUISE:** You can paint or decorate it however you like, Helen.

sd: *HELEN touches the coffin.*

- **HELEN:** (Quietly) I like it just how it is.
- **WOODY:** (Stroking the coffin) That's a fine piece of pine, isn't it? Plain and honest. I just hope it holds, that's all.**

sd: *Mock outrage from the women.*

- **ANNABEL:** Woody, do not undermine our work, it's our very own creation and we brought the job in on time.
- **SIOBHAN:** What do you think, Helen?
- **HELEN:** I think it's the real deal. Congratulations.
- **LOUISE:** To you too, you did all the sanding.
- **ANNABEL:** Congratulations to all of us.

sd: *Much cheering.*

- **ANNABEL:** And to you, Woody, for everything you've done. You've been very brave.

sd: *Even more cheering.*

- **SIOBHAN:** So, come on, Woody, crack open the champers, must be nearly race time. 

sd: *The women go over to the TV and gather around. HELEN turns the sound up.*

- **WOODY:** Champers? You told me to get booze in. So I did. Beers are in the fridge.**
- **SIOBHAN:** I said get something with bubbles.
- **WOODY:** Beer's got bubbles!**

sd: *Much booing.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Oh, for feck's sake. Right, I'm off to get us a bottle of the proper stuff. I've got time, haven't I?
- **HELEN:** If you're quick.
- **SIOBHAN:** It's just round the corner. There'll be something on Pineapple Highway.
- **HELEN:** We'll reimburse you with the sweepstake money.
- **WOODY:** What?**
- **LOUISE:** Good idea.
- **ANNABEL:** That way we all share the winnings.
- **WOODY:** Aw, but...**
- **SIOBHAN:** No 'aw but about it. Right, I'll ride like the wind.

sd: *SIOBHAN gets as far as the door. WOODY sees her helmet.*

- **WOODY:** Siobhan.**
- **SIOBHAN:** What?
- **WOODY:** Helmet.**

sd: *WOODY holds her helmet out.*

- **SIOBHAN:** Nah, it will just flatten my feathers!

sd: *SIOBHAN exits. WOODY joins the others crowded around the TV.*

sd: *Slowly the lights change. We hear the sound of the race then music of Kate Bush singing 'My Lagan Love' rises over it. The music increases as the stage lighting changes. The actors are almost in shadow. At a point in the music WOODY and the women stand and position themselves. Two on each side of the coffin. Their hats in their hands they place them on the coffin. Then they lift the coffin like pallbearers. They move downstage, turn and leave slowly to the music. Lights fade to black.*

**Scene Five**

sd: *Lights up. Mid-morning. HELEN, ANNABEL and LOUISE have coats over their black dresses. They are holding glasses of whiskey. ANNABEL holds the bottle. They drink in silence.*

- **LOUISE:** Do you think there'll be a lot of people?
- **ANNABEL:** Most of her family's back home, but she made friends so easily, didn't she?
- **HELEN:** I think it'll be packed to the rafters. It's not bloody right, though is it?
- **ANNABEL:** No. It's not right at all.
- **LOUISE:** I keep thinking, if only we'd agreed to just drink the beer..
- **ANNABEL:** (Comforting LOUISE) I know.
- **LOUISE:** It wasn't even very far.

sd: *They drink in silence.*

- **HELEN:** I keep thinking - and I know it's crazy, I know it's magical thinking - but what if we'd just made something else instead, like the doghouse or the bookcase-
- **ANNABEL:** There's no way us making a coffin for you had anything to do with Siobhan's accident, Helen.

# Page 127
- **HELEN:** I know, I mean, rationally I know, but that doesn't stop me thinking.
- **ANNABEL:** Imagine what I've been thinking. All the terrible things I said to her...
- **LOUISE:** She totally understood the reason behind that.
- **ANNABEL:** Doesn't stop me wishing I hadn't.
- **LOUISE:** It's just so hard to accept how random life is. Then I think about how random it was that we got to meet her in the first place. I'm so grateful for that.
- **HELEN:** Yes. Me too.
- **ANNABEL:** Meeting all of you, I'm so very grateful for that.

sd: *WOODY enters wearing a dark suit and tie.*

- **LOUISE:** Oh, you look lovely, Woody.
- **ANNABEL:** Very smart.
- **WOODY:** Thanks. I'd better have one of those. *(Indicates to the whiskey)***

sd: *ANNABEL pours him a glass and passes it to him.*

- **WOODY:** So, we'll take the one car then?**

sd: *The women nod in agreement. They drink their whiskey.
Beat.*

- **WOODY:** I, um ... I was sort of needing something to do the last few days, stop my head going over and over the same things, so I decided to ...**

sd: *WOODY goes and gets a beautifully crafted box in the shape of a shamrock.*

- **WOODY:** I made this. For Siobhan. For her ashes.**

sd: *The women all come to look at it.*

# Page 128

- **WOODY:** I'd asked her cousin, Jamie. He ... *(WOODY nods)***
- **LOUISE:** You made this? It's a shamrock. It's so beautiful.
- **ANNABEL:** It is. Beautiful.
- **HELEN:** (Starting to cry) Oh, shit, the last person you'd expect to start blubbing Sorry. That's quite something, Woody.
- **WOODY:** Don't be sorry. I've been blubbing for days. Her father's asked that she be brought home. It's what she would have wanted, too, I think. To be with her mum, and so that's what I'm going to do.**
- **LOUISE:** You're taking her back to Ireland?
- **WOODY:** Yeah, well, I offered. And they accepted. I've got the money from the house coming so**
- **LOUISE:** Oh, Woody.
- **ANNABEL:** That's a wonderful thing to do.

sd: *WOODY tries to hold things together and not break down in front of them all.*

- **WOODY:** Right, time we made a move, I think. You lot get in the car. I'll lock up.**

sd: *The women exit. HELEN is the last.*

- **WOODY:** So, Helen, you haven't got a coffin any more. I guess you'll just have to go on living.**
- **HELEN:** (Smiles) I'll do my best.

sd: *HELEN exits. WOODY stands looking at the shamrock box. He goes and takes the $20 off the dartboard.*

- **WOODY:** Come on, Irish. Let's go then.**

sd: *He walks to the door, turns out the lights and exits. Music as the lights fade to black.*

**The End.**
